Since emotions are highly subjective for users, we focus on emotion prediction for individuals instead of for the masses. Existing works on emotion prediction for individuals either focus on media content or social-influence alone, which are incomprehensive in predicting users' emotions. In this paper, we design a joint user-interest and social-influence emotion prediction framework for individuals, in which user-interest in multimodal media content and social-influence in social relations are both considered. To address the issue that for different users, the impacts of these two factors are different, a probabilistic graphical model is proposed to combine these two factors together, where a set of parameters are used to measure their importance in influencing the user's emotions, and they are learnt from the user's historical behaviors. We conduct experiments using real social media network to verify our algorithm and evaluate its performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our approach can substantially improve the emotion prediction performance.", "keywords": ["Emotion prediction", "Social-influence", "User-interest", "Social network"], "reference_count": 47, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] P.

To reveal the underlying intricate mechanism of information propagation, the problem of repost behavior prediction has recently drawn extensive attention. In this paper, we propose a novel method to measure time-sensitive mutual influence based on temporal behavior patterns of users and develop an efficient algorithm to calculate it via a discretization method. To predict repost behavior more accurately, we introduce another two features of user interests and information content, and respectively design the effective measurements of them to capture their predictive power. We further combine time-sensitive mutual influence with the two features into a feature-based method and evaluate the performance of the proposed method on repost prediction. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted on a real large-scale microblogging dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve better performance compared to several baseline methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a novel link prediction method (FLP-DLA) that is based on fuzzy social networks and distributed learning automata (DLA). Distributed learning automata are reinforcement-based optimization tools which try to learn and converge to the optimal behavior from environmental feedback using graph navigation. In the preprocessing phase of the FLP-DLA, the proposed method tries to calculate a fuzzy strength for each link based on the information of the network, such as event time. In the main phase of the FLP-DLA, it uses these fuzzy strengths in addition to DLA to determine the strength of test links. In each iteration of the proposed method, the DLA tries to find a path between the endpoints of a random test link; following this, the FLP-DLA calculates the fuzzy strength of the obtained path using the fuzzy strengths of the links through the path, and rewards or penalizes the DLA based on the path strength. The main phase is repeated until the LAs converge to an action. Finally, we use the strength of the test links as the output of the link prediction.

Conducting socially aware networking studies requires knowledge of both SNA and communication networking, but it is not easy for communication networking researchers who are unfamiliar with SNA to obtain comprehensive knowledge of SNA due to its interdisciplinary nature. This paper therefore aims to fill the knowledge gap for networking researchers who are interested in socially aware networking but are not familiar with SNA. This paper surveys three types of important SNA techniques for socially aware networking: identification of influential nodes, link prediction, and community detection. Then, this paper introduces how SNA techniques are used in socially aware networking and discusses research trends in socially aware networking.", "keywords": ["social network analysis", "socially aware networking", "influence", "link prediction", "community"], "reference_count": 238, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] D.J.

In this paper, we propose a retweeting prediction method for social hotspots based on tensor decomposition, using user information, relationship and behavioral data. The method can be used to predict the behavior of users and analyze the evolvement of topics. Firstly, we propose a tensor-based mechanism for mining user interaction, and then we propose that the tensor be used to solve the problem of inaccuracy that arises when interactively calculating intensity for sparse user interaction data. At the same time, we can analyze the influence of the following relationship on the interaction between users based on characteristics of the tensor in data space conversion and projection. Secondly, time decay function is introduced for the tensor to quantify further the evolution of user behavior in current social hotspots. That function can be fit to the behavior of a user dynamically, and can also solve the problem of interaction between users with time decay. Finally, we invoke time slices and discretization of the topic life cycle and construct a user retweeting prediction model based on logistic regression. In this way, we can both explore the temporal characteristics of user behavior in social hotspots and also solve the problem of uneven interaction behavior between users. Experiments show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of user behavior prediction effectively and aid in understanding the development trend of a topic.", "keywords": ["social network", "hotspot topic", "behavior analysis", "retweeting prediction", "tensor decomposition"], "reference_count": 35, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] K.L.

People are used to seeking useful information from the relationships among social members to support their decisions on investment, partner seeking and marketing. Corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for \u201cword of mouth\u201d advertising based on the relations between the customers. When we collect and observe relationships between people, missing or redundant relations unavoidably occur since the time and cost restrictions in market or social investigation prevent us to discover all the relations. Moreover, since the social relations are changing constantly, current social relations may disappear, and new relations will be established. Many trade and social networks consist of multiple types of relations between the individuals. This paper presents an efficient method to detect the potential and future social relations between individuals in multi-relational social networks using link prediction. First, we calculate the belief of each individual by belief propagation on each type of relations. Based on the belief vectors, the similarities between various types of relations are computed to measure their mutual influence. Based on the similarities between various types of relations, we model link prediction as the problem of matrix completion by optimizing its max-norm constrained formulation. We propose a projected gradient descent optimization algorithm which is scalable to large size networks. Empirical results on real multi-relational social networks demonstrate that the predicting results of our algorithm have higher quality compared with other similar algorithms.", "keywords": ["Multi-relational social networks", "Potential relations", "Link prediction", "Similarity", "Matrix completion"], "reference_count": 59, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1]\tRajarshi Chakraborty, Jaeung Lee, Sharmistha Bagchi-Sen, Shambhu Upadhyaya, H.

One interesting and important problem in the social networking services is to rank users based on their vitality in a timely fashion. An accurate ranking list of user vitality could benefit many parties in social network services such as the ads providers and site operators. Although it is very promising to obtain a vitality-based ranking list of users, there are many technical challenges due to the large scale and dynamics of social networking data. In this paper, we propose a unique perspective to achieve this goal, which is quantifying user vitality by analyzing the dynamic interactions among users on social networks. Examples of social network include but are not limited to social networks in microblog sites and academical collaboration networks. Intuitively, if a user has many interactions with his friends within a time period and most of his friends do not have many interactions with their friends simultaneously, it is very likely that this user has high vitality. Based on this idea, we develop quantitative measurements for user vitality and propose our first algorithm for ranking users based vitality. Also, we further consider the mutual influence between users while computing the vitality measurements and propose the second ranking algorithm, which computes user vitality in an iterative way. Other than user vitality ranking, we also introduce a vitality prediction problem, which is also of great importance for many applications in social networking services. Along this line, we develop a customized prediction model to solve the vitality prediction problem. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we collect two dynamic social network data sets. The experimental results with both data sets clearly demonstrate the advantage of our ranking and prediction methods.", "keywords": ["Distributed systems", "monitoring data", "social networks", "user activity", "vitality ranking", "vitality prediction"], "reference_count": 25, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] E.

One of the most intriguing aspects of social networks is to identify influencers who are experts on a specific topic. With the identification of these users within the network, many applications can be built for user recommendation, information diffusion modeling, viral marketing, user modeling and many more. In this paper, we aim to identify topic-based experts using a large dataset collected from Twitter. Our proposed approach has three phases: (1) identification of topics on social media posts (more specifically, tweets), (2) user modeling, based on a group of user specific features, and (3) Influence Factorization to identify topical influencers. The main advantage of the proposed method is to identify future influencers as well as current ones on Twitter. Moreover, it is an easy to implement algorithm using Spark MLlib, which can be easily extended to include other user specific features, and compare with other methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a large dataset that contains tweets of 180K user over 70 day period. The experimental results show that our proposed method identifies influencers successfully when used with a hybrid user specific feature that contains follower count and authenticity information, and is a highly scalable and extensible algorithm.", "keywords": ["Data mining", "Influence analysis", "Social media analysis", "Matrix Factorization", "Collaborative filtering", "Influence prediction", "Influence maximization"], "reference_count": 57, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] D.T.

Therefore, building a churn prediction model to facilitate subsequent churn management and customer retention is important. The churn behaviours and the impact of social neighbour influences to customer churn may be different for different types of users. Accordingly, we segment users into stable, unstable, and solitary user groups according to their social contact behaviours in VWs. Novel segmentation\u2010based churn prediction approaches are proposed for churn prediction in VWs by building prediction models for each type of user groups and considering the effect of social neighbour influences for different user groups. The proposed approaches are evaluated by conducting experiments with a dataset collected from a VW platform. The experimental results show different churn prediction performances under different user groups. The segmentation\u2010based churn prediction approaches perform better than do general approaches without considering user groups. Moreover, the results also reveal that social neighbour influences have a positive impact on stable and unstable users.

Understanding users\u2019 social in\ufb02uences in social networks can bene\ufb01t many applications, such as social recommendation and social marketing. In this paper, we focus on the problem of predicting users\u2019 social in\ufb02uences on upcoming events in EBSNs. We formulate this prediction problem as the estimation of unobserved entries of the constructed user-event social in\ufb02uence matrix, where each entry represents the in\ufb02uence value of a user on an event. In particular, we de\ufb01ne a user's social in\ufb02uence on a given event as the proportion of the user's friends who are in\ufb02uenced by him/her to attend the event. To solve this problem, we present a hybrid collaborative \ufb01ltering model, namely, Matrix Factorization with Event-User Neighborhood (MF-EUN) model, by incorporating both event-based and user-based neighborhood methods into matrix factorization. Due to the fact that the constructed social in\ufb02uence matrix is very sparse and the overlap values in the matrix are few, it is challenging to \ufb01nd reliable similar neighbors using the widely adopted similarity measures (e.g., Pearson correlation and Cosine similarity). To address this challenge, we propose an additional information based neighborhood discovery (AID) method by considering both event-speci\ufb01c and user-speci\ufb01c features in EBSNs. The parameters of our MF-EUN model are determined by minimizing the associated regularized squared error function through stochastic gradient descent. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation on real-world datasets collected from DoubanEvent. Experimental results show that our proposed hybrid collaborative \ufb01ltering model is superior than several alternatives, which provides excellent performance with RMSE and MAE reaching 0.248 and 0.1266 respectively in the 90% training data of 10 000 users dataset.t some potential future directions.", "keywords": ["Event-based social network  Social influence  Matrix factorization Neighborhood method Collaborative filtering"], "reference_count": 39, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] X.

In this paper, we propose a novel Modularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (M-NMF) model to incorporate the community structure into network embedding. We exploit the consensus relationship between the representations of nodes and community structure, and then jointly optimize NMF based representation learning model and modularity based community detection model in a unified framework, which enables the learned representations of nodes to preserve both of the microscopic and community structures.

Conventional social influence prediction approaches typically design various hand-crafted rules to extract user- and network-specific features. However, their effectiveness heavily relies on the knowledge of domain experts. As a result, it is usually difficult to generalize them into different domains. Inspired by the recent success of deep neural networks in a wide range of computing applications, we design an end-to-end framework, DeepInf, to learn users' latent feature representation for predicting social influence. In general, DeepInf takes a user's local network as the input to a graph neural network for learning her latent social representation. We design strategies to incorporate both network structures and user-specific features into convolutional neural and attention networks. Extensive experiments on Open Academic Graph, Twitter, Weibo, and Digg, representing different types of social and information networks, demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end model, DeepInf, significantly outperforms traditional feature engineering-based approaches, suggesting the effectiveness of representation learning for social applications.", "keywords": ["Representation Learning; Network Embedding; Graph Convolution;Graph Attention; Social In\ufb02uence; Social Networks"], "reference_count": 54, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": []}, {"author": ["Adrien Guille\uff0cC\u00e9cile Favre\uff0cHakim Hacid\uff0cDjamel Zighed"], "title": "Information Diffusion in Online Social Networks", "journal": "ACM Conference on Management of Data", "year": 2013, "DOI": "10.1145/2503792.2503797", "month": 5, "citations(google scholar)": 92, "abstract": "Online social networks play a major role in the spread of information at very large scale and it becomes essential to provide means to analyze this phenomenon.

Oceans of data generated by social media like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube present opportunities and challenges to studying collective behavior in a large scale. In this work, we aim to learn to predict collective behavior in social media. In particular, given information about some individuals, how can we infer the behavior of unobserved individuals in the same network? A social-dimension based approach is adopted to address the heterogeneity of connections presented in social media. However, the networks in social media are normally of colossal size, involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of actors. The scale of networks entails scalable learning of models for collective behavior prediction. To address the scalability issue, we propose an edge-centric clustering scheme to extract sparse social dimensions. With sparse social dimensions, the social-dimension based approach can efficiently handle networks of millions of actors while demonstrating comparable prediction performance as other non-scalable methods.", "keywords": ["Social Dimensions", "Behavior Prediction", "Social Media", "Relational Learning", "Edge-Centric Clustering"], "reference_count": 24, "ccfClass": "B", "important": false, "references": []}, {"author": ["Winter A.

We then examine larger-scale groupings by detecting communities algorithmically and comparing them to network partitions based on user characteristics. We thereby examine the relative importance of different characteristics at different institutions, finding for example that common high school is more important to the social organization of large institutions and that the importance of common major varies significantly between institutions.

In this paper, we present a new de\ufb01nition of in\ufb02uence that is tailored uniquely for online contexts and an associated methodology for gauging in\ufb02uence. According to our de\ufb01nition, in\ufb02uence entails the capacity to shift thepatternsofemotionlevelsexpressedbysocialmediausers.The source of in\ufb02uence may be the content of a user\u2019s message or the context of the relationship between exchanging users. Regardless of the source, measuring in\ufb02uence requires \ufb01rst identifying shifts inthepatternsofemotionlevelsexpressedbyusersandthenstudying the extent that these shifts can be associated with a user. This paper presents a new quantitative approach that combines the use of a text analysis program with a mathematical algorithm to derive trends in levels of emotions expressed in social media and, more importantly, detect breakpoints when those trends changed abruptly. First steps have also been taken to predict future trends in expressions (as well as quantify their accuracy). These methods constitute a new approach to quantifying in\ufb02uence in social media that focuses on detecting the impact of in\ufb02uence (e.g., shifts in levels of emotions expressed) as opposed to focusing on the dynamics of simple social media counts, e.g., retweets, followers, or likes", "keywords": ["Breakpoint", "emotion", "in\ufb02uence", "LIWC", "social media", "text analysis", "Twitter"], "reference_count": 60, "ccfClass": "0", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] G.

Secondly, to determine laws of individual behavior and group behavior within a social topic, a hotspot user participation behavior prediction model is proposed and associated with the basic concepts of random field and Markov property in information diffusion.

Nowadays, there have been deep studies conducted on the geographical and social influence in the point-of-interest recommendation model based on the rating prediction. The fact is, however, relying solely on the rating fails to reflect the user's preferences very accurately, because the users are most concerned with the list of ranked point-of-in-terests (POIs) on the actual output of recom-mender systems. In this paper, we propose a co-pairwise ranking model called Geo-Social Bayesian Personalized Ranking model (GSB-PR), which is based on the pairwise ranking with the exploiting geo-social correlations by incorporating the method of ranking learning into the process of POI recommendation. In this model, we develop a novel BPR pairwise ranking assumption by injecting users' geo-social preference. Based on this assumption, the POI recommendation model is reformulated by a three-level joint pairwise ranking model. And the experimental results based on real datasets show that the proposed method in this paper enjoys better recommendation performance compared to other state-of-the-art POI recommendation models.", "keywords": ["Social network services", "Correlation", "Bayes methods", "Business process re-engineering", "Task analysis", "Motion pictures", "Security"], "reference_count": 86, "ccfClass": "0", "important": true, "references": []}, {"author": ["Farzaneh Ghayour Baghbani\uff0cMasoud Asapour\uff0cHeshaam Faili"], "title": "Impact of context on social influence", "journal": "2016 24th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)", "year": 2016, "DOI": "10.1109/IranianCEE.2016.7585379", "month": 5, "citations(google scholar)": 37, "abstract": "Influence and information propagation is an important field in social network analysis.

It is generally difficult to obtain accurate prediction results of cascades over such networks, therefore a variety of diffusion models have been proposed in the literature to simulate diffusion processes instead. We argue that such models require extensive simulation results to produce good estimates of future spreads. In this work, we take a complimentary approach. We present a generalized, analytical model of influence in social networks that captures social influence at various levels of granularity, ranging from pairwise influence, to local neighborhood, to the general population, and external events, therefore capturing the complex dynamics of human behavior. We demonstrate that our model can integrate a variety of diffusion models. Particularly, we show that commonly used diffusion models in social networks can be reduced to special cases of our model, by carefully defining their parameters. Our goal is to provide a closed-form expression to approximate the probability of infection for every node in an arbitrary, directed network at any time t. We quantitatively evaluate the approximation quality of our analytical solution as compared to numerous popular diffusion models on a real-world dataset and a series of synthetic graphs", "keywords": ["computational models; diffusion models; dynamics; evolutionary models; influence; statistical modeling; social networks; social simulation"], "reference_count": 12, "ccfClass": "0", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[I] C.

With our proposed hydrodynamic information diffusion prediction model (hydro-IDP), we can accurately capture the information diffusion process from both temporal and spatial perspectives, and shed more light on the information spreading characteristics (e.g., information popularity, user influence, social platform diffusivity, etc.). We also conduct a large-scale trace-driven validation to verify the accuracy of our model.

In this paper, we study the problem of inverse influence in online social networks. Different from Personalized Page Rank, the inverse influence for a personalized node ranks nodes according to the probabilities that all nodes stop at the personalized node in limited steps. We propose two computation models for inverse influence, i.e., the random walk based and the path based. Both of the models have high computation complexity, and cannot be used in large graphs, so we propose a Monte Carlo based approximation algorithm.

However, social influence takes many forms, and its underlying mechanism is still unclear. For example, how is one\u2019s behavior influenced by a group of friends who know each other and by the friends from different ego friend circles? In this article, we study the social influence problem in a large microblogging network. Particularly, we consider users\u2019 (re)tweet behaviors and focus on investigating how friends in one\u2019s ego network influence retweet behaviors. We propose a novel notion of social influence locality and develop two instantiation functions based on pairwise influence and structural diversity. The defined influence locality functions have strong predictive power. Without any additional features, we can obtain an F1-score of 71.65% for predicting users\u2019 retweet behaviors by training a logistic regression classifier based on the defined influence locality functions. We incorporate social influence locality into a factor graph model, which can further leverage the network-based correlation. Our experiments on the large microblogging network show that the model significantly improves the precision of retweet prediction. Our analysis also reveals several intriguing discoveries. For example, if you have six friends retweeting a microblog, the average likelihood that you will also retweet it strongly depends on the structure among the six friends: The likelihood will significantly drop (only \u2159) when the six friends do not know each other, compared with the case when the six friends know each other.", "keywords": ["Human Factors", "Measurement", "Experimentation", "Performance", "Social network", "social influence", "microblog network", "retweet prediction"], "reference_count": 60, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Aris Anagnostopoulos , Ravi Kumar , Mohammad Mahdian, Influence and correlation in social networks, Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, August 24-27, 2008, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA  [doi>10.1145/1401890.1401897]"}, {"ref": "[2] Sinan Arala, Lev Muchnika, and Arun Sundararajan. 2009.

Analyzing the influence and spread of upcoming contents is an interesting and useful research direction, and has brilliant perspective on web advertising and spam detection. In this paper, a novel time series model for predicting the topics social influence has been introduced. In this model, the existing user-generated contents are summarized with a set of valued sequences, and a hybrid model consisting of topical, social and geographic attributes has been adopted for predicting influence trends of newly coming contents. The empirical study conducted on large real data sets indicates that our model is interesting and meaningful, and our methods are effective and efficient in practice.", "keywords": ["Social network", "Prediction", "Time series", "Multiple models"], "reference_count": 25, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] J.

We find that participants underestimate the likelihood that the people they approach will comply with their requests. This error is robust (it persists across various samples and requests) and substantial (on average, requesters underestimate compliance by 48%). We find that this error results from requesters' failure to appreciate the awkwardness of saying no to a request. In addition to reviewing evidence for the underestimation-of-compliance effect and its underlying mechanism, I discuss some factors that have been found to strengthen, attenuate, and reverse the effect.

Location based social networks (LBSNs) have flourished recently and are of great potential for movement behavior exploration and data-driven application design. While there have been some efforts on user check-in movement behavior in LBSNs, they lack comprehensive analysis of social influence on them. To this end, the social-spatial influence and social-temporal influence are analyzed synthetically in this paper based on the related information exposed in LBSNs. The check-in movement behaviors of users are found to be affected by their social friendships both from spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, a probabilistic model of user mobile behavior is proposed, incorporating the comprehensive social influence model with extent personal preference model. The experimental results validate that our proposed model can improve prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art social historical model considering temporal information (SHM+T), which mainly studies the temporal cyclic patterns and uses them to model user mobility, while being with affordable complexity.", "keywords": ["Human mobility", "location based social network (LBSN)", "location prediction", "social influence"], "reference_count": 16, "ccfClass": "", "important": false, "references": [{"ref": "[1]\tH.

Among customers predicted as churners, highly influential customers deserve special attention, since their churns can also trigger churns of their peers.

To this end, a procedure for determining the weak ground truth on churn influence is presented and used to determine the churn influence of prepaid customers. The determined scores are used to identify good churn-influence predictors among 74 candidate features. The identified predictors are finally used to build a churn-influence-prediction model. The results show that considerably better churn prediction results can be achieved using the proposed model together with the classical churn-prediction-model than by using the classical churn-prediction model alone. Moreover, the successfully predicted churners by the combined approach also have a greater number of churn followers. A successful retention of the predicted churners could greatly affect churn reduction since it could also prevent the churns of these followers.", "keywords": ["Churn prediction", "User influence", "Social network", "Weak ground truth", "Churn-influence model"], "reference_count": 27, "ccfClass": "", "important": false, "references": [{"ref": "[1]\tJ.

Real applications such as viral marketing and trending topic detection rely on information diffusion. Given past items with diffusion records on a social network, this paper aims at forecasting who will participate in the diffusion of a new item c (we use hashtags in the paper) with its k earliest adopters, without using content and profile information, i.e., finding which users will adopt c in the future. We define the Diffusion Participation Forecasting (DPF) problem, which is challenging since all users except for early adopters can be the candidates, comparing to existing studies that predict which one-layer followers will adopt a new hashtag given past diffusion observations with content and profile info. To solve the DFP problem, we propose an Adoption-based Participation Ranking (APR) model, which aims to rank the actual participants in reality at higher positions. The first is to estimate the adoption probability of a new hashtag for each user while the second is a random walk-based model that incorporates nodes with higher adoption probability values and early adopters to generate the forecasted participants. Experiments conducted on Twitter exhibit that our model can significantly outperform several competing methods in terms of Precision and Recall. Moreover, we demonstrate that an accurate DPF can be applied for effective targeted marketing using influence maximization and boosting the accuracy of popularity prediction in social media.", "keywords": ["Diffusion forecasting", "Information diffusion", "Social network", "Diffusion participation", "Social influence", "Popularity prediction"], "reference_count": 40, "ccfClass": "B", "important": false, "references": [{"ref": "[1]\tA.

In particular, we focus on investigating how a reciprocal (two-way) link, the basic relationship in social networks, is developed from a parasocial (one-way) relationship and how the relationships further develop into triadic closure, one of the fundamental processes of link formation. We first investigate how geographic distance and interactions between users influence the formation of link structure among users. Then we study how social theories including homophily, social balance, and social status are satisfied over networks with parasocial and reciprocal relationships. The study unveils several interesting phenomena. For example, \"friend's friend is a friend\" indeed exists in the reciprocal relationship network, but does not hold in the parasocial relationship network. We propose a learning framework to formulate the problems of predicting reciprocity and triadic closure into a graphical model.

Understanding users\u2019 social in\ufb02uences in social networks can bene\ufb01t many applications, such as social recommendation and social marketing. In this paper, we focus on the problem of predicting users\u2019 social in\ufb02uences on upcoming events in EBSNs. We formulate this prediction problem as the estimation of unobserved entries of the constructed userevent social in\ufb02uence matrix, where each entry represents the in\ufb02uence value of a user on an event. In particular, we de\ufb01ne a user\u2019s social in\ufb02uence on a given event as the proportion of the user\u2019s friends who are in\ufb02uenced by him/her to attend the event. To solve this problem, we present a combined collaborative \ufb01ltering model, namely, Matrix Factorization with Event Neighborhood (MF-EN) model, by incorporating event-based neighborhood method into matrix factorization. Due to the fact that the constructed social in\ufb02uence matrix is very sparse and the overlap values in the matrix are few, it is challenging to \ufb01nd reliable similar event neighbors using the widely adopted similarity measures (e.g., Pearson correlation and Cosine similarity). To address this challenge, we propose an additional information based neighborhood discovery (AID) method by considering three event-speci\ufb01c features in EBSNs. The parameters of our MF-EN model are determined by minimizing the associated regularized squared error function through stochastic gradient descent. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation on real-world datasets collected from DoubanEvent. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model compared to several alternatives.", "keywords": [""], "reference_count": 31, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "1.

In this paper, we design a joint user-interest and social-influence emotion prediction framework for individuals, in which user-interest in multimodal media content and social-influence in social relations are both considered. To address the issue that for different users, the impacts of these two factors are different, a probabilistic graphical model is proposed to combine these two factors together, where a set of parameters are used to measure their importance in influencing the user's emotions, and they are learnt from the user's historical behaviors. We conduct experiments using real social media network to verify our algorithm and evaluate its performance.

People sharing information (such as blogs, news, albums, etc.) is the basic behavior. In this paper, we focus on predicting item-level social in\ufb02uence to answer the question Who should share What, which can be extended into two information retrieval scenarios: (1) Users ranking: given an item, who should share it so that its di\ufb00usion range can be maximized in a social network; (2) Web posts ranking: given a user, what should she share to maximize her in\ufb02uence among her friends.

The network density and centrality metrics are used to obtain the intuitionistic fuzzy metrics of the micro relationships.

Salient examples of link recommendation include \u201cPeople You May Know\u201d on Facebook and LinkedIn as well as \u201cYou May Know\u201d on Google+. The main stakeholders of an online social network include users (e.g., Facebook users) who use the network to socialize with other users and an operator (e.g., Facebook Inc.) that establishes and operates the network for its own benefit (e.g., revenue). Existing link recommendation methods recommend links that are likely to be established by users but overlook the benefit a recommended link could bring to an operator. To address this gap, we define the utility of recommending a link and formulate a new research problem\u2014the utility-based link recommendation problem. We then propose a novel utility-based link recommendation method that recommends links based on the value, cost, and linkage likelihood of a link, in contrast to existing link recommendation methods that focus solely on linkage likelihood. Specifically, our method models the dependency relationship between the value, cost, linkage likelihood, and utility-based link recommendation decision using a Bayesian network; predicts the probability of recommending a link with the Bayesian network; and recommends links with the highest probabilities. Using data obtained from a major U.S. online social network, we demonstrate significant performance improvement achieved by our method compared with prevalent link recommendation methods from representative prior research.", "keywords": ["utility-based link recommendation", "link prediction", "Bayesian network learning", "continuous latent factor", "online social network", "machine learning", "network formation"], "reference_count": 54, "ccfClass": "C", "important": false, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Adali, S., F.
