Beyond face detection and face recognition, which have been extensively studied over the past decade, perhaps the most interesting aspect related to human-centered images is the relationship of people in the image. In this work, we focus on a novel solution to the latter problem, in particular the kin relationships. To this end, we constructed two databases: the first one named UB KinFace Ver2.0, which consists of images of children, their young parents and old parents, and the second one named FamilyFace. Next, we develop a transfer subspace learning based algorithm in order to reduce the significant differences in the appearance distributions between children and old parents facial images. Moreover, by exploring the semantic relevance of the associated metadata, we propose an algorithm to predict the most likely kin relationships embedded in an image. In addition, human subjects are used in a baseline study on both databases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithms can effectively annotate the kin relationships among people in an image and semantic context can further improve the accuracy.", "keywords": ["Context", "face recognition", "kinship verification", "semantics."], "reference_count": 49, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Z.

There arise strong needs for automatically understanding the group types (e.g., family vs. classmates) for recommendation services (e.g., recommending a family-friendly restaurant) and even predicting the pairwise relationships (e.g., mother-child) between the people in the photo for mining implicit social connections. Interestingly, we observe that the group photos are composed of atomic subgroups corresponding to certain social relationships. For this work, we propose a novel framework to (1) connect faces of different attributes and positions as a face graph and (2) discover informative subgraphs to represent social subgroups in group photos. A group photo can be further represented by a bag-of-face-subgraphs (BoFG) -- the occurring frequency of social subgroups, which is informative to categorize specific group types or events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BoFG in recognizing family photos and achieve 30.5% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art low-level features. Moreover, we propose to predict the pairwise relationships (e.g., husband-wife) in a face graph by the co-occurrence information (e.g., co-occurring with a child) in the mined subgraphs. The experiments demonstrate that the informative social subgroups significantly outperform prior work (36% relatively) which considers merely facial attributes for determining pairwise relationships.", "keywords": ["Face graph", "face subgraph mining", "social relationship"], "reference_count": 31, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] available at http://www.flickr.com/photos/spencerfinnley/5377578656/, http://www.flickr.com/photos/spolyak/1031569673/."}, {"ref": "[2] M.

In this paper, we consider the difficult task of determining parent-offspring resemblance using deep learning to answer the question \"Who do I look like?\" Although humans can perform this job at a rate higher than chance, it is not clear how they do it [2]. However, recent studies in anthropology [24] have determined which features tend to be the most discriminative. In this study, we aim to not only create an accurate system for resemblance detection, but bridge the gap between studies in anthropology with computer vision techniques. Further, we aim to answer two key questions: 1) Do offspring resemble their parents? and 2) Do offspring resemble one parent more than the other? We propose an algorithm that fuses the features and metrics discovered via gated autoencoders with a discriminative neural network layer that learns the optimal, or what we call genetic, features to delineate parent-offspring relationships. We further analyze the correlation between our automatically detected features and those found in anthropological studies. Meanwhile, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in kinship verification by 3-10% depending on the relationship using specific (father-son, mother-daughter, etc.) and generic models.", "keywords": ["None"], "reference_count": 28, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] D.

In this work, we tackle the problem of one-versus-two (tri-subject) kinship verification and our contributions are threefold: 1) a novel relative symmetric bilinear model (RSBM) is introduced to model the similarity between the child and the parents, by incorporating the prior knowledge that a child may resemble one particular parent more than the other; 2) a spatially voted method for feature selection, which jointly selects the most discriminative features for the child-parents pair, while taking local spatial information into account; and 3) a large-scale tri-subject kinship database characterized by over 1,000 child-parents families.

To extend FIW, we further improved upon this process with a novel semi-automatic labeling scheme that used annotated faces and unlabeled text metadata to discover labels, which were then used, along with existing FIW data, for the proposed clustering algorithm that generated label proposals for all newly added data-both processes are shared and compared in depth, showing great savings in time and human input required. Essentially, the clustering algorithm proposed is semi-supervised and uses labeled data to produce more accurate clusters. We statistically compare FIW to related datasets, which unarguably shows enormous gains in overall size and amount of information encapsulated in the labels. We benchmark two tasks, kinship verification and family classification, at scales incomparably larger than ever before. Pre-trained CNN models fine-tuned on FIW outscores other conventional methods and achieved state-of-the art on the renowned KinWild datasets. We also measure human performance on kinship recognition and compare to a fine-tuned CNN.", "keywords": ["Large-scale image dataset", "kinship verification", "family classification", "semi-supervised clustering", "deep learning"], "reference_count": 72, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] R.

However, most of existing distance metric learning (DML) based solutions rely on linearity assumption of the kinship metric model, and the domain knowledge of large cross-generation discrepancy (e.g., large age span and gender difference between parent and child images) has not been considered in metric learning, leading to degraded performance for genetic similarity measure on human faces. To address these limitations, we propose in this work a new kinship metric learning (KML) method with a coupled deep neural network (DNN) model. KML explicitly models the cross-generation discrepancy inherent on parent-child pairs, and learns a coupled deep similarity metric such that the image pairs with kinship relation are pulled close, while those without kinship relation (but with high appearance similarity) are pushed as far away as possible. Moreover, by imposing the intra-connection diversity and inter-connection consistency over the coupled DNN, we introduce the property of hierarchical compactness into the coupled network to facilitate deep metric learning with limited amount of kinship training data. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm on several kinship benchmarks against the state-of-the-art DML alternatives, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method.", "keywords": ["Face recognition", "Kinship verification", "Metric learning", "Deep neural network", "Hierarchical compactness"], "reference_count": 66, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] A.

Developing techniques to analyze such relations from visual data bears great potential to build machines that better understand us and are capable of interacting with us at a social level. Previous investigations have remained partial due to the overwhelming diversity and complexity of the topic and consequently have only focused on a handful of social relations. In this paper, we argue that the domain-based theory from social psychology is a great starting point to systematically approach this problem. The theory provides coverage of all aspects of social relations and equally is concrete and predictive about the visual attributes and behaviors defining the relations included in each domain. We provide the first dataset built on this holistic conceptualization of social life that is composed of a hierarchical label space of social domains and social relations. We also contribute the first models to recognize such domains and relations and find superior performance for attribute based features. Beyond the encouraging performance of the attribute based approach, we also find interpretable features that are in accordance with the predictions from social psychology literature. Beyond our findings, we believe that our contributions more tightly interleave visual recognition and social psychology theory that has the potential to complement the theoretical work in the area with empirical and data-driven models of social life.", "keywords": ["None"], "reference_count": 48, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Bugental, D.B.: Acquisition of the Algorithms of Social Life: A Domain-Based Approach.

In the computer vision literature, much progress has been made in scene understanding, such as object detection and scene parsing. Recent research focuses on the relationship between objects based on its functionality and geometrical relations. In this work, we aim to study the problem of social relationship recognition, in still images. We have proposed a dual-glance model for social relationship recognition, where the first glance fixates at the individual pair of interest and the second glance deploys attention mechanism to explore contextual cues. We have also collected a new large scale People in Social Context (PISC) dataset, which comprises of 22,670 images and 76,568 annotated samples from 9 types of social relationship. We provide benchmark results on the PISC dataset, and qualitatively demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model.", "keywords": ["None"], "reference_count": 43, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] A.

We investigate if such fine-grained and high-level relation traits can be characterized and quantified from face images in the wild. We address this challenging problem by first studying a deep network architecture for robust recognition of facial expressions. Unlike existing models that typically learn from facial expression labels alone, we devise an effective multitask network that is capable of learning from rich auxiliary attributes such as gender, age, and head pose, beyond just facial expression data. While conventional supervised training requires datasets with complete labels (e.g., all samples must be labeled with gender, age, and expression), we show that this requirement can be relaxed via a novel attribute propagation method. The approach further allows us to leverage the inherent correspondences between heterogeneous attribute sources despite the disparate distributions of different datasets. With the network we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on existing facial expression recognition benchmarks. To predict inter-personal relation, we use the expression recognition network as branches for a Siamese model. Extensive experiments show that our model is capable of mining mutual context of faces for accurate fine-grained interpersonal prediction.", "keywords": ["Facial expression recognition", "Interpersonal relation", "Deep convolutional network"], "reference_count": 99, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1]  Bi, W., & Kwok, J.

Automatically interpreting such relationships bears a great potential for the intelligent systems to understand human behavior in depth and to better interact with people at a social level. Human beings interpret the social relationships within a group not only based on the people alone, and the interplay between such social relationships and the contextual information around the people also plays a significant role. However, these additional cues are largely overlooked by the previous studies. We found that the interplay between these two factors can be effectively modeled by a novel structured knowledge graph with proper message propagation and attention. And this structured knowledge can be efficiently integrated into the deep neural network architecture to promote social relationship understanding by an end-to-end trainable Graph Reasoning Model (GRM), in which a propagation mechanism is learned to propagate node message through the graph to explore the interaction between persons of interest and the contextual objects. Meanwhile, a graph attentional mechanism is introduced to explicitly reason about the discriminative objects to promote recognition.

To this end, we need systems that can understand social relationships in diverse social contexts. Inferring the social context in a given visual scene not only involves recognizing objects, but also demands a more in-depth understanding of the relationships and attributes of the people involved. To achieve this, one computational approach for representing human relationships and attributes is to use an explicit knowledge graph, which allows for high-level reasoning. We introduce a novel end-to-end-trainable neural network that is capable of generating a Social Relationship Graph - a structured, unified representation of social relationships and attributes - from a given input image. Our Social Relationship Graph Generation Network (SRG-GN) is the first to use memory cells like Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to iteratively update the social relationship states in a graph using scene and attribute context. The neural network exploits the recurrent connections among the GRUs to implement message passing between nodes and edges in the graph, and results in significant improvement over previous methods for social relationship recognition.", "keywords": ["None"], "reference_count": 28, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] M.

However, automatically recognizing social relations in images is a challenging task due to the significant gap between the domains of visual content and social relation. Existing studies separately process various features such as faces expressions, body appearance, and contextual objects, thus they cannot comprehensively capture the multi-granularity semantics, such as scenes, regional cues of persons, and interactions among persons and objects. To bridge the domain gap, we propose a Multi-Granularity Reasoning framework for social relation recognition from images. The global knowledge and mid-level details are learned from the whole scene and the regions of persons and objects, respectively. Most importantly, we explore the fine-granularity pose keypoints of persons to discover the interactions among persons and objects. Specifically, the pose-guided Person-Object Graph and Person-Pose Graph are proposed to model the actions from persons to object and the interactions between paired persons, respectively. Based on the graphs, social relation reasoning is performed by graph convolutional networks. Finally, the global features and reasoned knowledge are integrated as a comprehensive representation for social relation recognition.

To appropriately describe role's relationships in movies, we devise a method to quantify relations and construct role's social networks, called RoleNet.

In this work, social relations between roles are used to be the context information of video scenes, and leading roles and the corresponding communities can be automatically determined. The results of community identification provide new alternatives in media management and browsing. Moreover, by describing video scenes with role's context, social-relation-based story segmentation method is developed to pave a new way for this widely-studied topic. Experimental results show the effectiveness of leading role determination and community identification. We also demonstrate that the social-based story segmentation approach works much better than the conventional tempo-based method.

In this paper, we take the first step towards learning the relations among movie characters using visual and auditory cues. Specifically, we use support vector regression to estimate local characterization of adverseness at the scene level. Such local properties are then synthesized via statistical learning based on Gaussian processes to derive the affinity between the movie characters. Once the affinity is learned, we perform social network analysis to find communities of characters and identify the leader of each community.

In this paper, the StoryRoleNet model is proposed for constructing an accurate and integral network representing the relationships among roles. First, to avoid the redundancy calculation of the relationships on the segmentation points of neighboring story units, we measure the weights of relationships by a weighted-Gaussian method in each story unit. More importantly, a new story segmentation method for long video is proposed by analyzing hierarchical features of the video. Then, we combine relationship networks constructed from the video and subtitle text. Some missed relationships can be complemented by this way. At last, the final network is analyzed to discover communities and important roles. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted using three movies and one television drama.

Diversified knowledge is demonstrated as the storyline of the video unfolds. Therefore, realization of automatically constructing social relation network from massive video data facilitates the deep semantics of mining big data, which includes face recognition and social relation recognition. For face recognition, previous studies are focus on high-level features of face and multiple body cues. However, these methods are mostly based on supervised learning and clustering need to specify clusters k, which cannot recognize characters when new video data is input and individual and its numbers are unknown. For social relation recognition, previous studies are concentrated on images and videos. However, these methods are only concentrated on social relations in same frame and incapable of extracting social relation of characters that are not present in the same frame. In this paper, a model named SRE-Net is proposed for building social relation network to address these challenges. First, MoCNR algorithm is introduced by clustering similar-appearing faces from different keyframes of video. As far as we know, it is the first algorithm to identify character nodes using unsupervised double-clustering methods. Second, we propose a scene based social relation recognition method to solve challenges that cannot recognize social relations of characters in different frames.

This paper explores the possibility of learning an efficient facial representation for video-based kinship verification by exploiting the visual transformation between facial appearance of kin pairs. To this end, a Siamese-like coupled convolutional encoder-decoder network is proposed. To reveal resemblance patterns of kinship while discarding the similarity patterns that can also be observed between people who do not have a kin relationship, a novel contrastive loss function is defined in the visual appearance space. For further optimization, the learned representation is fine-tuned using a feature-based contrastive loss. An expression matching procedure is employed in the model to minimize the negative influence of expression differences between kin pairs. Each kin video is analyzed by a sliding temporal window to leverage short-term facial dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed on seven different kin relationships using smile videos of kin pairs.

While several attempts have been made on facial kinship verification from still images, to our knowledge, the problem of video-based kinship verification has not been formally addressed in the literature. In this paper, we make the two contributions to video-based kinship verification. On one hand, we present a new video face dataset called Kinship Face Videos in the Wild (KFVW) which were captured in wild conditions for the video-based kinship verification study, as well as the standard benchmark. On the other hand, we employ our benchmark to evaluate and compare the performance of several state-of-the-art metric learning based kinship verification methods. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed dataset and the effectiveness of existing metric learning methods for video-based kinship verification. Lastly, we also evaluate human ability on kinship verification from facial videos and experimental results show that metric learning based computational methods are not as good as that of human observers.", "keywords": ["Kinship verification", "Metric learning", "Face recognition", "Video-based"], "reference_count": 73, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] M.F.

Existing research in kinship verification primarily focuses on kinship prediction with image pairs. In this research, we propose a new deep learning framework for kinship verification in unconstrained videos using a novel Supervised Mixed Norm AutoEncoder (SMNAE). This new autoencoder formulation introduces class-specific sparsity in the weight matrix. The proposed three-stage SMNAE based kinship verification framework utilizes the learned spatio-temporal representation in the video frames for verifying kinship in a pair of videos. A new kinship video (KIVI) database of more than 500 individuals with variations due to illumination, pose, occlusion, ethnicity, and expression is collected for this research. It comprises a total of 355 true kin video pairs with over 250 000 still frames. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the KIVI database and six existing kinship databases. On the KIVI database, SMNAE yields video-based kinship verification accuracy of 83.18% which is at least 3.2% better than existing algorithms. The algorithm is also evaluated on six publicly available kinship databases and compared with best reported results. It is observed that the proposed SMNAE consistently yields best results on all the databases.", "keywords": ["None"], "reference_count": 52, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] A.

However, due to variations in capture conditions (background, pose, expression, illumination and occlusion), state-of-the-art systems currently provide a low level of accuracy. As in many visual recognition and affective computing applications, kinship verification may benefit from a combination of discriminant information extracted from both video and audio signals. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the fusion audio-visual information from both face and voice modalities to improve kinship verification accuracy. First, we propose a new multi-modal kinship dataset called TALking KINship (TALKIN), that is comprised of several pairs of video sequences with subjects talking. State-of-the-art conventional and deep learning models are assessed and compared for kinship verification using this dataset. Finally, we propose a deep Siamese network for multi-modal fusion of kinship relations. Experiments with the TALKIN dataset indicate that the proposed Siamese network provides a significantly higher level of accuracy over baseline uni-modal and multi-modal fusion techniques for kinship verification. Results also indicate that audio (vocal) information is complementary and useful for kinship verification problem.", "keywords": ["None"], "reference_count": 39, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] T.

While social network analysis from videos has started to gain attention in the recent years, the existing work either uses proximity or co-occurrence statistics, or exploit a holistic model of the scene content where the relations are assumed to stay constant throughout the video. This work permits changing relations and argues that there exists a relationship between the visual concepts and the social relations among actors, which is a fundamentally new concept in computer vision. Specifically, we leverage the existing large-scale concept detectors to generate concept score vectors to represent the video content, and we further map them to grouping cues that are used to detect the social structure. In our framework, a probabilistic graphical model with temporal smoothing provides a means to analyze social relations among actors and detect communities.

Especially, the widespread of video in social media and intelligent surveillance gives us a new chance to discover the social relations among people. Previous researches mostly focus on the recognition of social relations from texts, blogs, or images. However, these methods are only concentrated on limited social relations and incapable of dealing with video data. In this paper, we address the challenges of social relation recognition by employing a multi-stream model to exploit the abundant multimodal information in videos. First of all, we build a video dataset with 16 categories of social relations annotation according to psychology and sociology studies, named Social Relation In Videos (SRIV), which comprises of 3,124 videos. According to our knowledge, it is the first video dataset for the social relation recognition. Secondly, we propose a multi-stream deep learning model as a benchmark for recognizing social relations, which learns high level semantic information of spatial, temporal, and audio of people\u2019s social interactions in videos. Finally, we fuse them with logical regression to achieve accurate recognition. Experimental results show that the multi-stream deep model is effective for social relation recognition on the proposed dataset.", "keywords": ["Social relation", "Video analysis", "Deep learning"], "reference_count": 19, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Luan, M.N.: Context-aware text representation for social relation aided sentiment analysis.

On one hand, the actions and storylines in videos provide more important cues for social relation recognition. On the other hand, the key persons may appear at arbitrary spatial-temporal locations, even not in one same image from beginning to the end. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Reasoning (MSTR) framework to recognize social relations from videos. For the spatial representation, we not only adopt a temporal segment network to learn global action and scene information, but also design a Triple Graphs model to capture visual relations between persons and objects. For the temporal domain, we propose a Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network to perform temporal reasoning with multi-scale receptive fields, which can obtain both long-term and short-term storylines in videos. By this means, MSTR can comprehensively explore the multi-scale actions and storylines in spatial-temporal dimensions for social relation reasoning in videos.

In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal attention model based on Multi-View (STMV) for understanding social relations from video. First, in order to obtain rich representation for social relation traits, we introduce different ConvNets to extract multi-view features including RGB, optical flow, and face. Second, we exploit temporal features of multi-view through time using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for social relation understanding. Specially, we propose multiple attention units in our attention module. Through this manner, we can generate an appropriate feature representation focusing on multiple aspects of social relation traits from video, thus excellent mapping function from low-level video pixels to high-level social relation space can be built. Third, we introduce a tensor fusion layer, which learns interactions among multi-view features.

We propose a novel framework aimed at conducting joint inference of the above tasks, as reasoning about each in isolation typically fails in our setting. Given noisy tracklets of people and detections of large objects and scene surfaces (e.g., building, grass), we use a spatiotemporal AND-OR graph to drive our joint inference, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and dynamic programming. We also introduce a new formalism of spatiotemporal templates characterizing latent sub-events.

The proposed framework relies merely on the visual analysis of egocentric photo-streams and consists of three major steps. The first step is to detect social interactions of the user where the impact of several social signals on the task is explored. The detected social events are inspected in the second step for categorization into different social meetings. These two steps act at event-level where each potential social event is modeled as a multi-dimensional time-series, whose dimensions correspond to a set of relevant features for each task; finally, LSTM is employed to classify the time-series. The last step of the framework is to characterize social patterns of the user. Our goal is to quantify the duration, the diversity and the frequency of the user social relations in various social situations. This goal is achieved by the discovery of recurrences of the same people across the whole set of social events related to the user. Experimental evaluation over EgoSocialStyle - the proposed dataset in this work, and EGO-GROUP demonstrates promising results on the task of social pattern characterization from egocentric photo-streams.", "keywords": ["Social pattern characterization", "Social signal extraction", "Lifelogging", "Convolutional and recurrent neural networks"], "reference_count": 57, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Aghaei, Dimiccoli, Radeva, 2015 M.

Developing computational models to understand social relationships from visual data is essential for building intelligent machines that can better interact with humans in a social environment. In this work, we study the problem of visual social relationship recognition in images. We propose a Dual-Glance model for social relationship recognition, where the first glance fixates at the person of interest and the second glance deploys attention mechanism to exploit contextual cues. To enable this study, we curated a large scale People in Social Context (PISC) dataset, which comprises of 23,311 images and 79,244 person pairs with annotated social relationships. Since visually identifying social relationship bears certain degree of uncertainty, we further propose an Adaptive Focal Loss to leverage the ambiguous annotations for more effective learning. We conduct extensive experiments to quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, which yields state-of-the-art performance on social relationship recognition.", "keywords": ["Social Relationship", "Label Ambiguity", "Context-driven Analysis", "Attention"], "reference_count": 61, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Agrawal A, Batra D, Parikh D, Kembhavi A (2018) Don't just assume; look and answer: Overcoming priors for visual question answering.

Although people\u2019s happiness is significantly affected by the quality of social relationships, there are few studies focusing on this aspect. This motivates us to propose a method to discover potential social relation traits, the interpersonal feelings between two people, from visual lifelog data to improve the status of our relationships. We propose Facial Multi-Attribute Framework (FMAF), a flexible network that can embed different sets of multiple pre-trained Facial Single-Attribute Networks to capture various facial features such as head pose, expression, age, and gender for social trait evaluation. We adopt the architecture of Inception-Resnet-V2 to each single attribute component to utilize the flexibility of Inception model and avoid the degradation problem with the residual module. We use a Siamese network with two FMAFs to evaluate social relation traits for two main persons in an image. Our experiment on the social relation trait dataset by Zhangpeng Zhang et.al shows that our method achieves the accuracy of 77.30%, which is 4.10% higher than the state-of-the-art result (73.20%). We also develop a prototype system integrated into Facebook to analyse and visualize the chronological changes in social traits between a user with friends in daily lives via uploaded photos and video clips.", "keywords": ["Social Relation Trait", "Visual LifeLog Data", "Facial Multi-Attribute Framework"], "reference_count": 25, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Bettadapura, V.

Since emotions are highly subjective for users, we focus on emotion prediction for individuals instead of for the masses.

In this paper, we design a joint user-interest and social-influence emotion prediction framework for individuals, in which user-interest in multimodal media content and social-influence in social relations are both considered. To address the issue that for different users, the impacts of these two factors are different, a probabilistic graphical model is proposed to combine these two factors together, where a set of parameters are used to measure their importance in influencing the user's emotions, and they are learnt from the user's historical behaviors. We conduct experiments using real social media network to verify our algorithm and evaluate its performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our approach can substantially improve the emotion prediction performance.", "keywords": ["Emotion prediction", "Social-influence", "User-interest", "Social network"], "reference_count": 47, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] P.

To reveal the underlying intricate mechanism of information propagation, the problem of repost behavior prediction has recently drawn extensive attention. In this paper, we propose a novel method to measure time-sensitive mutual influence based on temporal behavior patterns of users and develop an efficient algorithm to calculate it via a discretization method. To predict repost behavior more accurately, we introduce another two features of user interests and information content, and respectively design the effective measurements of them to capture their predictive power. We further combine time-sensitive mutual influence with the two features into a feature-based method and evaluate the performance of the proposed method on repost prediction. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted on a real large-scale microblogging dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve better performance compared to several baseline methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a novel link prediction method (FLP-DLA) that is based on fuzzy social networks and distributed learning automata (DLA). Distributed learning automata are reinforcement-based optimization tools which try to learn and converge to the optimal behavior from environmental feedback using graph navigation. In the preprocessing phase of the FLP-DLA, the proposed method tries to calculate a fuzzy strength for each link based on the information of the network, such as event time. In the main phase of the FLP-DLA, it uses these fuzzy strengths in addition to DLA to determine the strength of test links. In each iteration of the proposed method, the DLA tries to find a path between the endpoints of a random test link; following this, the FLP-DLA calculates the fuzzy strength of the obtained path using the fuzzy strengths of the links through the path, and rewards or penalizes the DLA based on the path strength. The main phase is repeated until the LAs converge to an action. Finally, we use the strength of the test links as the output of the link prediction. The results reported in this paper have proven satisfactory, indicating the usefulness of the proposed method for some social network datasets.", "keywords": ["Social network", "Fuzzy graph", "Learning automata"], "reference_count": 37, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] L\u00fc L, Zhou T (2011) Link prediction in complex networks: A survey.

In this paper, we propose a retweeting prediction method for social hotspots based on tensor decomposition, using user information, relationship and behavioral data. The method can be used to predict the behavior of users and analyze the evolvement of topics. Firstly, we propose a tensor-based mechanism for mining user interaction, and then we propose that the tensor be used to solve the problem of inaccuracy that arises when interactively calculating intensity for sparse user interaction data. At the same time, we can analyze the influence of the following relationship on the interaction between users based on characteristics of the tensor in data space conversion and projection. Secondly, time decay function is introduced for the tensor to quantify further the evolution of user behavior in current social hotspots. That function can be fit to the behavior of a user dynamically, and can also solve the problem of interaction between users with time decay. Finally, we invoke time slices and discretization of the topic life cycle and construct a user retweeting prediction model based on logistic regression. In this way, we can both explore the temporal characteristics of user behavior in social hotspots and also solve the problem of uneven interaction behavior between users. Experiments show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of user behavior prediction effectively and aid in understanding the development trend of a topic.", "keywords": ["social network", "hotspot topic", "behavior analysis", "retweeting prediction", "tensor decomposition"], "reference_count": 35, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] K.L.

People are used to seeking useful information from the relationships among social members to support their decisions on investment, partner seeking and marketing. Corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for \u201cword of mouth\u201d advertising based on the relations between the customers. When we collect and observe relationships between people, missing or redundant relations unavoidably occur since the time and cost restrictions in market or social investigation prevent us to discover all the relations. Moreover, since the social relations are changing constantly, current social relations may disappear, and new relations will be established. Many trade and social networks consist of multiple types of relations between the individuals. This paper presents an efficient method to detect the potential and future social relations between individuals in multi-relational social networks using link prediction. First, we calculate the belief of each individual by belief propagation on each type of relations. Based on the belief vectors, the similarities between various types of relations are computed to measure their mutual influence. Based on the similarities between various types of relations, we model link prediction as the problem of matrix completion by optimizing its max-norm constrained formulation. We propose a projected gradient descent optimization algorithm which is scalable to large size networks. Empirical results on real multi-relational social networks demonstrate that the predicting results of our algorithm have higher quality compared with other similar algorithms.", "keywords": ["Multi-relational social networks", "Potential relations", "Link prediction", "Similarity", "Matrix completion"], "reference_count": 59, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1]\tRajarshi Chakraborty, Jaeung Lee, Sharmistha Bagchi-Sen, Shambhu Upadhyaya, H.

One interesting and important problem in the social networking services is to rank users based on their vitality in a timely fashion. An accurate ranking list of user vitality could benefit many parties in social network services such as the ads providers and site operators. Although it is very promising to obtain a vitality-based ranking list of users, there are many technical challenges due to the large scale and dynamics of social networking data. In this paper, we propose a unique perspective to achieve this goal, which is quantifying user vitality by analyzing the dynamic interactions among users on social networks. Examples of social network include but are not limited to social networks in microblog sites and academical collaboration networks. Intuitively, if a user has many interactions with his friends within a time period and most of his friends do not have many interactions with their friends simultaneously, it is very likely that this user has high vitality. Based on this idea, we develop quantitative measurements for user vitality and propose our first algorithm for ranking users based vitality. Also, we further consider the mutual influence between users while computing the vitality measurements and propose the second ranking algorithm, which computes user vitality in an iterative way. Other than user vitality ranking, we also introduce a vitality prediction problem, which is also of great importance for many applications in social networking services. Along this line, we develop a customized prediction model to solve the vitality prediction problem. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we collect two dynamic social network data sets. The experimental results with both data sets clearly demonstrate the advantage of our ranking and prediction methods.", "keywords": ["Distributed systems", "monitoring data", "social networks", "user activity", "vitality ranking", "vitality prediction"], "reference_count": 25, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] E.

One of the most intriguing aspects of social networks is to identify influencers who are experts on a specific topic. With the identification of these users within the network, many applications can be built for user recommendation, information diffusion modeling, viral marketing, user modeling and many more. In this paper, we aim to identify topic-based experts using a large dataset collected from Twitter. Our proposed approach has three phases: (1) identification of topics on social media posts (more specifically, tweets), (2) user modeling, based on a group of user specific features, and (3) Influence Factorization to identify topical influencers. The main advantage of the proposed method is to identify future influencers as well as current ones on Twitter. Moreover, it is an easy to implement algorithm using Spark MLlib, which can be easily extended to include other user specific features, and compare with other methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a large dataset that contains tweets of 180K user over 70 day period. The experimental results show that our proposed method identifies influencers successfully when used with a hybrid user specific feature that contains follower count and authenticity information, and is a highly scalable and extensible algorithm.", "keywords": ["Data mining", "Influence analysis", "Social media analysis", "Matrix Factorization", "Collaborative filtering", "Influence prediction", "Influence maximization"], "reference_count": 57, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] D.T.

Understanding users\u2019 social in\ufb02uences in social networks can bene\ufb01t many applications, such as social recommendation and social marketing. In this paper, we focus on the problem of predicting users\u2019 social in\ufb02uences on upcoming events in EBSNs. We formulate this prediction problem as the estimation of unobserved entries of the constructed user-event social in\ufb02uence matrix, where each entry represents the in\ufb02uence value of a user on an event. In particular, we de\ufb01ne a user's social in\ufb02uence on a given event as the proportion of the user's friends who are in\ufb02uenced by him/her to attend the event. To solve this problem, we present a hybrid collaborative \ufb01ltering model, namely, Matrix Factorization with Event-User Neighborhood (MF-EUN) model, by incorporating both event-based and user-based neighborhood methods into matrix factorization. Due to the fact that the constructed social in\ufb02uence matrix is very sparse and the overlap values in the matrix are few, it is challenging to \ufb01nd reliable similar neighbors using the widely adopted similarity measures (e.g., Pearson correlation and Cosine similarity). To address this challenge, we propose an additional information based neighborhood discovery (AID) method by considering both event-speci\ufb01c and user-speci\ufb01c features in EBSNs.

In this paper, we propose a novel Modularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (M-NMF) model to incorporate the community structure into network embedding. We exploit the consensus relationship between the representations of nodes and community structure, and then jointly optimize NMF based representation learning model and modularity based community detection model in a unified framework, which enables the learned representations of nodes to preserve both of the microscopic and community structures.

Conventional social influence prediction approaches typically design various hand-crafted rules to extract user- and network-specific features. However, their effectiveness heavily relies on the knowledge of domain experts. As a result, it is usually difficult to generalize them into different domains. Inspired by the recent success of deep neural networks in a wide range of computing applications, we design an end-to-end framework, DeepInf, to learn users' latent feature representation for predicting social influence. In general, DeepInf takes a user's local network as the input to a graph neural network for learning her latent social representation. We design strategies to incorporate both network structures and user-specific features into convolutional neural and attention networks. Extensive experiments on Open Academic Graph, Twitter, Weibo, and Digg, representing different types of social and information networks, demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end model, DeepInf, significantly outperforms traditional feature engineering-based approaches, suggesting the effectiveness of representation learning for social applications.", "keywords": ["Representation Learning; Network Embedding; Graph Convolution;Graph Attention; Social In\ufb02uence; Social Networks"], "reference_count": 54, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": []}, {"author": ["Adrien Guille\uff0cC\u00e9cile Favre\uff0cHakim Hacid\uff0cDjamel Zighed"], "title": "Information Diffusion in Online Social Networks", "journal": "ACM Conference on Management of Data", "year": 2013, "DOI": "10.1145/2503792.2503797", "month": 5, "citations(google scholar)": 92, "abstract": "Online social networks play a major role in the spread of information at very large scale and it becomes essential to provide means to analyze this phenomenon.

These functions take timeliness into account using a time discretization method. Secondly, to determine laws of individual behavior and group behavior within a social topic, a hotspot user participation behavior prediction model is proposed and associated with the basic concepts of random field and Markov property in information diffusion.

Nowadays, there have been deep studies conducted on the geographical and social influence in the point-of-interest recommendation model based on the rating prediction. The fact is, however, relying solely on the rating fails to reflect the user's preferences very accurately, because the users are most concerned with the list of ranked point-of-in-terests (POIs) on the actual output of recom-mender systems. In this paper, we propose a co-pairwise ranking model called Geo-Social Bayesian Personalized Ranking model (GSB-PR), which is based on the pairwise ranking with the exploiting geo-social correlations by incorporating the method of ranking learning into the process of POI recommendation. In this model, we develop a novel BPR pairwise ranking assumption by injecting users' geo-social preference. Based on this assumption, the POI recommendation model is reformulated by a three-level joint pairwise ranking model. And the experimental results based on real datasets show that the proposed method in this paper enjoys better recommendation performance compared to other state-of-the-art POI recommendation models.", "keywords": ["Social network services", "Correlation", "Bayes methods", "Business process re-engineering", "Task analysis", "Motion pictures", "Security"], "reference_count": 86, "ccfClass": "0", "important": true, "references": []}, {"author": ["Farzaneh Ghayour Baghbani\uff0cMasoud Asapour\uff0cHeshaam Faili"], "title": "Impact of context on social influence", "journal": "2016 24th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)", "year": 2016, "DOI": "10.1109/IranianCEE.2016.7585379", "month": 5, "citations(google scholar)": 37, "abstract": "Influence and information propagation is an important field in social network analysis.

It is generally difficult to obtain accurate prediction results of cascades over such networks, therefore a variety of diffusion models have been proposed in the literature to simulate diffusion processes instead. We argue that such models require extensive simulation results to produce good estimates of future spreads. In this work, we take a complimentary approach. We present a generalized, analytical model of influence in social networks that captures social influence at various levels of granularity, ranging from pairwise influence, to local neighborhood, to the general population, and external events, therefore capturing the complex dynamics of human behavior. We demonstrate that our model can integrate a variety of diffusion models. Particularly, we show that commonly used diffusion models in social networks can be reduced to special cases of our model, by carefully defining their parameters. Our goal is to provide a closed-form expression to approximate the probability of infection for every node in an arbitrary, directed network at any time t. We quantitatively evaluate the approximation quality of our analytical solution as compared to numerous popular diffusion models on a real-world dataset and a series of synthetic graphs", "keywords": ["computational models; diffusion models; dynamics; evolutionary models; influence; statistical modeling; social networks; social simulation"], "reference_count": 12, "ccfClass": "0", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[I] C.

With our proposed hydrodynamic information diffusion prediction model (hydro-IDP), we can accurately capture the information diffusion process from both temporal and spatial perspectives, and shed more light on the information spreading characteristics (e.g., information popularity, user influence, social platform diffusivity, etc.). We also conduct a large-scale trace-driven validation to verify the accuracy of our model. The results show that the hydro-IDP model is competent to characterize and predict the process of information propagation in mobile social networks.", "keywords": ["Mathematical model", "Hydrodynamics", "Predictive models", "Social network services", "Mobile computing", "Mobile communication", "Data models"], "reference_count": 33, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] X.

Social influence analysis can be used in many real applications, such as link prediction, friend recommendation and personalized searching. Personalized Page Rank, which ranks nodes according to the probabilities that a random walk starting from a personalized node stops at all nodes, is one of the most popular metrics for influence analysis. In this paper, we study the problem of inverse influence in online social networks. Different from Personalized Page Rank, the inverse influence for a personalized node ranks nodes according to the probabilities that all nodes stop at the personalized node in limited steps. We propose two computation models for inverse influence, i.e., the random walk based and the path based. Both of the models have high computation complexity, and cannot be used in large graphs, so we propose a Monte Carlo based approximation algorithm. Experiments from synthetic and real world datasets show that, our algorithm has equivalent or even better accuracy than related researches in link prediction, and thus can be used in friend recommendation in online social networks.", "keywords": ["Graphs", "personalized PageRank", "inverse influence", "random walk", "link prediction"], "reference_count": 44, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] L.

However, social influence takes many forms, and its underlying mechanism is still unclear. For example, how is one\u2019s behavior influenced by a group of friends who know each other and by the friends from different ego friend circles? In this article, we study the social influence problem in a large microblogging network. Particularly, we consider users\u2019 (re)tweet behaviors and focus on investigating how friends in one\u2019s ego network influence retweet behaviors. We propose a novel notion of social influence locality and develop two instantiation functions based on pairwise influence and structural diversity. The defined influence locality functions have strong predictive power. Without any additional features, we can obtain an F1-score of 71.65% for predicting users\u2019 retweet behaviors by training a logistic regression classifier based on the defined influence locality functions. We incorporate social influence locality into a factor graph model, which can further leverage the network-based correlation. Our experiments on the large microblogging network show that the model significantly improves the precision of retweet prediction. Our analysis also reveals several intriguing discoveries. For example, if you have six friends retweeting a microblog, the average likelihood that you will also retweet it strongly depends on the structure among the six friends: The likelihood will significantly drop (only \u2159) when the six friends do not know each other, compared with the case when the six friends know each other.", "keywords": ["Human Factors", "Measurement", "Experimentation", "Performance", "Social network", "social influence", "microblog network", "retweet prediction"], "reference_count": 60, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Aris Anagnostopoulos , Ravi Kumar , Mohammad Mahdian, Influence and correlation in social networks, Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, August 24-27, 2008, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA  [doi>10.1145/1401890.1401897]"}, {"ref": "[2] Sinan Arala, Lev Muchnika, and Arun Sundararajan. 2009.

We find that participants underestimate the likelihood that the people they approach will comply with their requests. This error is robust (it persists across various samples and requests) and substantial (on average, requesters underestimate compliance by 48%). We find that this error results from requesters' failure to appreciate the awkwardness of saying no to a request.

Location based social networks (LBSNs) have flourished recently and are of great potential for movement behavior exploration and data-driven application design. While there have been some efforts on user check-in movement behavior in LBSNs, they lack comprehensive analysis of social influence on them. To this end, the social-spatial influence and social-temporal influence are analyzed synthetically in this paper based on the related information exposed in LBSNs. The check-in movement behaviors of users are found to be affected by their social friendships both from spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, a probabilistic model of user mobile behavior is proposed, incorporating the comprehensive social influence model with extent personal preference model. The experimental results validate that our proposed model can improve prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art social historical model considering temporal information (SHM+T), which mainly studies the temporal cyclic patterns and uses them to model user mobility, while being with affordable complexity.", "keywords": ["Human mobility", "location based social network (LBSN)", "location prediction", "social influence"], "reference_count": 16, "ccfClass": "", "important": false, "references": [{"ref": "[1]\tH.

Among customers predicted as churners, highly influential customers deserve special attention, since their churns can also trigger churns of their peers. The aim of this study is to find good predictors of churn influence in a mobile service network. To this end, a procedure for determining the weak ground truth on churn influence is presented and used to determine the churn influence of prepaid customers. The determined scores are used to identify good churn-influence predictors among 74 candidate features. The identified predictors are finally used to build a churn-influence-prediction model. The results show that considerably better churn prediction results can be achieved using the proposed model together with the classical churn-prediction-model than by using the classical churn-prediction model alone. Moreover, the successfully predicted churners by the combined approach also have a greater number of churn followers. A successful retention of the predicted churners could greatly affect churn reduction since it could also prevent the churns of these followers.", "keywords": ["Churn prediction", "User influence", "Social network", "Weak ground truth", "Churn-influence model"], "reference_count": 27, "ccfClass": "", "important": false, "references": [{"ref": "[1]\tJ.

Real applications such as viral marketing and trending topic detection rely on information diffusion. Given past items with diffusion records on a social network, this paper aims at forecasting who will participate in the diffusion of a new item c (we use hashtags in the paper) with its k earliest adopters, without using content and profile information, i.e., finding which users will adopt c in the future. We define the Diffusion Participation Forecasting (DPF) problem, which is challenging since all users except for early adopters can be the candidates, comparing to existing studies that predict which one-layer followers will adopt a new hashtag given past diffusion observations with content and profile info. To solve the DFP problem, we propose an Adoption-based Participation Ranking (APR) model, which aims to rank the actual participants in reality at higher positions. The first is to estimate the adoption probability of a new hashtag for each user while the second is a random walk-based model that incorporates nodes with higher adoption probability values and early adopters to generate the forecasted participants. Experiments conducted on Twitter exhibit that our model can significantly outperform several competing methods in terms of Precision and Recall. Moreover, we demonstrate that an accurate DPF can be applied for effective targeted marketing using influence maximization and boosting the accuracy of popularity prediction in social media.", "keywords": ["Diffusion forecasting", "Information diffusion", "Social network", "Diffusion participation", "Social influence", "Popularity prediction"], "reference_count": 40, "ccfClass": "B", "important": false, "references": [{"ref": "[1]\tA.

In particular, we focus on investigating how a reciprocal (two-way) link, the basic relationship in social networks, is developed from a parasocial (one-way) relationship and how the relationships further develop into triadic closure, one of the fundamental processes of link formation. We first investigate how geographic distance and interactions between users influence the formation of link structure among users. Then we study how social theories including homophily, social balance, and social status are satisfied over networks with parasocial and reciprocal relationships. The study unveils several interesting phenomena. For example, \"friend's friend is a friend\" indeed exists in the reciprocal relationship network, but does not hold in the parasocial relationship network. We propose a learning framework to formulate the problems of predicting reciprocity and triadic closure into a graphical model. We demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 90% of reciprocal relationships in a Twitter network. The proposed model also achieves better performance (+20-30% in terms of Fl-measure) than several alternative methods for predicting the triadic closure formation.", "keywords": [""], "reference_count": 40, "ccfClass": "B", "important": false, "references": [{"ref": "[1] BACKSTROM, L., KUMAR, R., MARLOW, C., NOVAK, J., AND TOMKINS, A. 2008.

Understanding users\u2019 social in\ufb02uences in social networks can bene\ufb01t many applications, such as social recommendation and social marketing. In this paper, we focus on the problem of predicting users\u2019 social in\ufb02uences on upcoming events in EBSNs. We formulate this prediction problem as the estimation of unobserved entries of the constructed userevent social in\ufb02uence matrix, where each entry represents the in\ufb02uence value of a user on an event. In particular, we de\ufb01ne a user\u2019s social in\ufb02uence on a given event as the proportion of the user\u2019s friends who are in\ufb02uenced by him/her to attend the event. To solve this problem, we present a combined collaborative \ufb01ltering model, namely, Matrix Factorization with Event Neighborhood (MF-EN) model, by incorporating event-based neighborhood method into matrix factorization. Due to the fact that the constructed social in\ufb02uence matrix is very sparse and the overlap values in the matrix are few, it is challenging to \ufb01nd reliable similar event neighbors using the widely adopted similarity measures (e.g., Pearson correlation and Cosine similarity). To address this challenge, we propose an additional information based neighborhood discovery (AID) method by considering three event-speci\ufb01c features in EBSNs. The parameters of our MF-EN model are determined by minimizing the associated regularized squared error function through stochastic gradient descent.

Since emotions are highly subjective for users, we focus on emotion prediction for individuals instead of for the masses. Existing works on emotion prediction for individuals either focus on media content or social-influence alone, which are incomprehensive in predicting users' emotions. In this paper, we design a joint user-interest and social-influence emotion prediction framework for individuals, in which user-interest in multimodal media content and social-influence in social relations are both considered. To address the issue that for different users, the impacts of these two factors are different, a probabilistic graphical model is proposed to combine these two factors together, where a set of parameters are used to measure their importance in influencing the user's emotions, and they are learnt from the user's historical behaviors. We conduct experiments using real social media network to verify our algorithm and evaluate its performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our approach can substantially improve the emotion prediction performance.", "keywords": ["Emotion prediction; Social-influence; User-interest; Social network"], "reference_count": 47, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] P.

Salient examples of link recommendation include \u201cPeople You May Know\u201d on Facebook and LinkedIn as well as \u201cYou May Know\u201d on Google+. The main stakeholders of an online social network include users (e.g., Facebook users) who use the network to socialize with other users and an operator (e.g., Facebook Inc.) that establishes and operates the network for its own benefit (e.g., revenue). Existing link recommendation methods recommend links that are likely to be established by users but overlook the benefit a recommended link could bring to an operator. To address this gap, we define the utility of recommending a link and formulate a new research problem\u2014the utility-based link recommendation problem. We then propose a novel utility-based link recommendation method that recommends links based on the value, cost, and linkage likelihood of a link, in contrast to existing link recommendation methods that focus solely on linkage likelihood. Specifically, our method models the dependency relationship between the value, cost, linkage likelihood, and utility-based link recommendation decision using a Bayesian network; predicts the probability of recommending a link with the Bayesian network; and recommends links with the highest probabilities. Using data obtained from a major U.S. online social network, we demonstrate significant performance improvement achieved by our method compared with prevalent link recommendation methods from representative prior research.", "keywords": ["utility-based link recommendation", "link prediction", "Bayesian network learning", "continuous latent factor", "online social network", "machine learning", "network formation"], "reference_count": 54, "ccfClass": "C", "important": false, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Adali, S., F.

Nevertheless, the complete temporal formation process of networks characterized by sequential interactive events between nodes has yet seldom been modeled in the existing studies, which calls for further research on the so-called temporal network embedding problem. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce the concept of neighborhood formation sequence to describe the evolution of a node, where temporal excitation effects exist between neighbors in the sequence, and thus we propose a Hawkes process based Temporal Network Embedding (HTNE) method. HTNE well integrates the Hawkes process into network embedding so as to capture the influence of historical neighbors on the current neighbors. In particular, the interactions of low-dimensional vectors are fed into the Hawkes process as base rate and temporal influence, respectively. In addition, attention mechanism is also integrated into HTNE to better determine the influence of historical neighbors on current neighbors of a node. Experiments on three large-scale real-life networks demonstrate that the embeddings learned from the proposed HTNE model achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods in various tasks including node classification, link prediction, and embedding visualization. In particular, temporal recommendation based on arrival rate inferred from node embeddings shows excellent predictive power of the proposed model.", "keywords": ["Temporal Network", "Network Embedding", "Learning Representation", "Hawkes Process"], "reference_count": 30, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] AmrAhmed,NinoShervashidze,ShravanNarayanamurthy,VanjaJosifovski,and Alexander J.

In real world, networks, like social network and biological networks, are dynamic and evolving over time. However, almost all the existing network embedding methods focus on static networks while ignore network dynamics. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning approach, DynamicTriad, to preserve both structural information and evolution patterns of a given network. The general idea of our approach is to impose triad, which is a group of three vertices and is one of the basic units of networks. In particular, we model how a closed triad, which consists of three vertices connected with each other, develops from an open triad that has two of three vertices not connected with each other. This triadic closure process is a fundamental mechanism in the formation and evolution of networks, thereby makes our model being able to capture the network dynamics and to learn representation vectors for each vertex at different time steps. Experimental results on three real-world networks demonstrate that, compared with several state-of-the-art techniques, DynamicTriad achieves substantial gains in several application scenarios. For example, our approach can effectively be applied and help to identify telephone frauds in a mobile network, and to predict whether a user will repay her loans or not in a loan network.", "keywords": ["Network Embedding", "Dynamic Network\u00df", "Triad Closure Process"], "reference_count": 30, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "Belkin, M., and Niyogi, P. 2001.

Due to the curse of dimensionality and sparsity in graphical datasets, this approach has become indispensable for machine learning tasks over large networks. The majority of the existing literature has considered this technique under the assumption that the network is static. However, networks in many applications, including social networks, collaboration networks, and recommender systems, nodes, and edges accrue to a growing network as streaming. A small number of very recent results have addressed the problem of embedding for dynamic networks. However, they either rely on knowledge of vertex attributes, suffer high-time complexity or need to be re-trained without closed-form expression. Thus the approach of adapting the existing methods designed for static networks or dynamic networks to the streaming environment faces non-trivial technical challenges.These challenges motivate developing new approaches to the problems of streaming graph embedding. In this paper, we propose a new framework that is able to generate latent representations for new vertices with high efficiency and low complexity under specified iteration rounds. We formulate a constrained optimization problem for the modification of the representation resulting from a stream arrival. We show this problem has no closed-form solution and instead develop an online approximation solution. Our solution follows three steps: (1) identify vertices affected by newly arrived ones, (2) generating latent features for new vertices, and (3) updating the latent features of the most affected vertices. The new representations are guaranteed to be feasible in the original constrained optimization problem. Meanwhile, the solution only brings about a small change to existing representations and only slightly changes the value of the objective function.

Recently, a few studies have focused on learning temporal information in addition to the topology of a graph. Most of these studies have relied on learning to represent nodes and substructures in dynamic graphs. However, the representation learning problem for entire graphs in a dynamic context is yet to be addressed. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised representation learning architecture for dynamic graphs, designed to learn both the topological and temporal features of the graphs that evolve over time. The approach consists of a sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder model embedded with gated graph neural networks (GGNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). The GGNN is able to learn the topology of the graph at each time step, while LSTMs are leveraged to propagate the temporal information among the time steps. Moreover, an encoder learns the temporal dynamics of an evolving graph and a decoder reconstructs the dynamics over the same period of time using the encoded representation provided by the encoder. We demonstrate that our approach is capable of learning the representation of a dynamic graph through time by applying the embeddings to dynamic graph classification using a real world dataset of animal behaviour.", "keywords": ["dynamic graph", "representation learning", "recurrent models"], "reference_count": 42, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] B.

The core issue is how to effectively use topology and timing information to improve performance. This paper proposes a model called NeLSTM combining network embedding with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) network to predict temporal network topology structure, which is represented by node vectors. First, to measure the impact of a past link on the future network, we add a time attenuation coefficient to the weight of a node pair. Then, network embedding is able to preserve the network topology information and based on its output, LSTM can characterize the continuous network evolution. Finally, NeLSTM obtains the similarity of a node pair via calculating the inner product, which exactly represents the possibility that a link occurs. Experimental results show that NeLSTM performs well in real world networks.", "keywords": ["Attenuation", "Predictive models", "Network topology", "Aging", "Facebook", "Task analysis"], "reference_count": 18, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] GetoorL,DiehlCP.Linkmining:asurvey.ACMSIGKDD Explorations Newsletter.

With the success of these graph neural networks (GNN) in the static setting, we approach further practical scenarios where the graph dynamically evolves. For this case, combining the GNN with a recurrent neural network (RNN, broadly speaking) is a natural idea. Existing approaches typically learn one single graph model for all the graphs, by using the RNN to capture the dynamism of the output node embeddings and to implicitly regulate the graph model. In this work, we propose a different approach, coined EvolveGCN, that uses the RNN to evolve the graph model itself over time. This model adaptation approach is model oriented rather than node oriented, and hence is advantageous in the flexibility on the input. For example, in the extreme case, the model can handle at a new time step, a completely new set of nodes whose historical information is unknown, because the dynamism has been carried over to the GNN parameters. We evaluate the proposed approach on tasks including node classification, edge classification, and link prediction. The experimental results indicate a generally higher performance of EvolveGCN compared with related approaches.", "keywords": ["EvolveGCN", "RNN", "Node Classification"], "reference_count": 32, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[Belkin and Niyogi 2002] Belkin, M., and Niyogi, P. 2002.

The learned embeddings could advance various learning tasks such as node classification, network clustering, and link prediction. Most, if not all, of the existing works, are overwhelmingly performed in the context of plain and static networks. Nonetheless, in reality, network structure often evolves over time with addition/deletion of links and nodes. Also, a vast majority of real-world networks are associated with a rich set of node attributes, and their attribute values are also naturally changing, with the emerging of new content patterns and the fading of old content patterns. These changing characteristics motivate us to seek an effective embedding representation to capture network and attribute evolving patterns, which is of fundamental importance for learning in a dynamic environment. To our best knowledge, we are the first to tackle this problem with the following two challenges: (1) the inherently correlated network and node attributes could be noisy and incomplete, it necessitates a robust consensus representation to capture their individual properties and correlations; (2) the embedding learning needs to be performed in an online fashion to adapt to the changes accordingly. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a novel dynamic attributed network embedding framework - DANE. In particular, DANE first provides an offline method for a consensus embedding and then leverages matrix perturbation theory to maintain the freshness of the end embedding results in an online manner. We perform extensive experiments on both synthetic and real attributed networks to corroborate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.", "keywords": ["Dynamic Networks", "A\u008attributed Networks", "Network Embedding"], "reference_count": 56, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Lada A Adamic and Bernardo A Huberman. 2000.

One basic requirement of network embedding is to preserve the structure and inherent properties of the networks. While previous network embedding methods primarily preserve the microscopic structure, such as the first- and second-order proximities of nodes, the mesoscopic community structure, which is one of the most prominent feature of networks, is largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel Modularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (M-NMF) model to incorporate the community structure into network embedding. We exploit the consensus relationship between the representations of nodes and community structure, and then jointly optimize NMF based representation learning model and modularity based community detection model in a unified framework, which enables the learned representations of nodes to preserve both of the microscopic and community structures. We also provide efficient updating rules to infer the parameters of our model, together with the correctness and convergence guarantees.

Examples include epidemic threshold, graph robustness, etc. It is often of key importance to accurately monitor these parameters. For example, knowing that Ebola virus has already been brought to the US continent, to avoid the virus from spreading away, it is important to know which emerging connections among related people would cause great reduction on the epidemic threshold of the network. However, most, if not all, of the existing algorithms computing these measures assume that the input graph is static, despite the fact that almost all real graphs are evolving over time. In this paper, we propose two online algorithms to track the eigen-functions of a dynamic graph with linear complexity wrt the number of nodes and number of changed edges in the graph. The key idea is to leverage matrix perturbation theory to efficiently update the top eigen-pairs of the underlying graph without recomputing them from scratch at each time stamp. Experiment results demonstrate that our methods can reach up to 20\u00d7 speedup with precision more than 80% for fairly long period of time.", "keywords": ["dynamic graph", "connectivity; graph spectrum", "attribution analysis"], "reference_count": 31, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Charu Aggarwal and Karthik Subbian.

However, most existing embedding methods focus on the static network while neglecting the evolving characteristic of real-world networks. Meanwhile, most of previous methods cannot well preserve the high-order proximity, which is a critical structural property of networks. These problems motivate us to seek an effective and efficient way to preserve the high-order proximity in embedding vectors when the networks evolve over time. In this paper, we propose a novel method of Dynamic High-order Proximity preserved Embedding (DHPE). Specifically, we adopt the generalized SVD (GSVD) to preserve the high-order proximity. Then, by transforming the GSVD problem to a generalized eigenvalue problem, we propose a generalized eigen perturbation to incrementally update the results of GSVD to incorporate the changes of dynamic networks. Further, we propose an accelerated solution to the DHPE model so that it achieves a linear time complexity with respect to the number of nodes and number of changed edges in the network. Our empirical experiments on one synthetic network and several real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.", "keywords": ["Dynamic Network\uff0cHigh-order Proximity\uff0cNetwork Embedding"], "reference_count": 37, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] D.

However, the cold-start issue and the special properties of social networks, such as rich temporal dynamics, heterogeneous and complex structures with millions of nodes, render the most commonly used recommendation approaches (e.g. Collaborative Filtering) inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-granularity dynamic network embedding (m-DNE) model for the social recommendation which is capable of recommending relevant users and interested items. In order to support online recommendation, we construct a heterogeneous user-item (HUI) network and incrementally maintain it as the social network evolves. m-DNE jointly captures the temporal semantic effects, social relationships and user behavior sequential patterns in a unified way by embedding the HUI network into a shared low dimensional space. Meanwhile, multi-granularity proximities which include the second-order proximity and the community-aware high-order proximity of nodes, are introduced to learn more informative and robust network representations. Then, with an efficient search method, we use the encoded representation of temporal contexts to generate recommendations. Experimental results on several real large-scale datasets show its advantages over other state-of-the-art methods.", "keywords": ["Social recommendation", "Heterogeneous social network", "Network embedding", "Temporal context", "Community detection"], "reference_count": 26, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1]Sedhain, S., Sanner, S., Braziunas, D., Xie, L., Christensen, J.: Social collaborative filtering for cold-start recommendations.

The current related work on node embedding exploits only a portion of existing networks, e.g., static networks.

We propose a highly efficient node embedding method, DNPS, that is faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art methods and that can further boost the training progress, especially under dynamic conditions. In this paper, we attempt to model the hierarchical and dynamic features of social networks by designing a damping-based sampling algorithm corresponding to a local search-based incremental learning algorithm, which can easily be extended to large-scale scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world social networks with three challenging tasks, including missing link prediction, dynamic link prediction, and multi-label classification.

Incremental SVD approaches are proposed to process newly changed nodes and edges in dynamic networks. However, incremental SVD approaches suffer from serious error accumulation inevitably due to approximation on incremental updates. SVD restart is an effective approach to reset the aggregated error, but when to restart SVD for dynamic networks is not addressed in literature. In this paper, we propose TIMERS, Theoretically Instructed Maximum-Error-bounded Restart of SVD, a novel approach which optimally sets the restart time in order to reduce error accumulation in time. Specifically, we monitor the margin between reconstruction loss of incremental updates and the minimum loss in SVD model. To reduce the complexity of monitoring, we theoretically develop a lower bound of SVD minimum loss for dynamic networks and use the bound to replace the minimum loss in monitoring. By setting a maximum tolerated error as a threshold, we can trigger SVD restart automatically when the margin exceeds this threshold. We prove that the time complexity of our method is linear with respect to the number of local dynamic changes, and our method is general across different types of dynamic networks. We conduct extensive experiments on several synthetic and real dynamic networks. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods by reducing 27% to 42% in terms of the maximum error for dynamic network reconstruction when fixing the number of restarts. Our method reduces the number of restarts by 25% to 50% when fixing the maximum error tolerated.", "keywords": ["0"], "reference_count": 20, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Barab \u00b4 asi, A.-L., and Albert, R. \u00b4 1999.

Lots of state-of-the-art network embedding methods based on Skip-gram framework are efficient and effective.

In this paper, we propose a stable dynamic embed- ding framework with high efficiency. It is an extension for the Skip-gram based network embedding methods, which can keep the optimality of the objective in the Skip-gram based methods in theory. Our model can not only generalize to the new ver- tex representation, but also update the most affected original vertex representations during the evolvement of the network. Multi-class classification on three real-world networks demonstrates that, our model can update the vertex representations efficiently and achieve the performance of retraining simultaneously. Besides, the visualization experimental result illustrates that, our model is capable of avoiding the embedding space drifting.", "keywords": ["Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning", "Machine Learning Applications: Networks"], "reference_count": 25, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Belkin and Niyogi, 2001.

Nevertheless, the complete temporal formation process of networks characterized by sequential interactive events between nodes has yet seldom been modeled in the existing studies, which calls for further research on the so-called temporal network embedding problem. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce the concept of neighborhood formation sequence to describe the evolution of a node, where temporal excitation effects exist between neighbors in the sequence, and thus we propose a Hawkes process based Temporal Network Embedding (HTNE) method. HTNE well integrates the Hawkes process into network embedding so as to capture the influence of historical neighbors on the current neighbors. In particular, the interactions of low-dimensional vectors are fed into the Hawkes process as base rate and temporal influence, respectively. In addition, attention mechanism is also integrated into HTNE to better determine the influence of historical neighbors on current neighbors of a node. Experiments on three large-scale real-life networks demonstrate that the embeddings learned from the proposed HTNE model achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods in various tasks including node classification, link prediction, and embedding visualization. In particular, temporal recommendation based on arrival rate inferred from node embeddings shows excellent predictive power of the proposed model.", "keywords": ["Temporal Network", "Network Embedding", "Learning Representation", "Hawkes Process"], "reference_count": 30, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Amr Ahmed, Nino Shervashidze, Shravan Narayanamurthy, Vanja Josifovski, and Alexander J.

Given an evolutionary network, it is crucial to detect structural anomalies, such as vertices and edges whose \u201cbehaviors\u201d deviate from underlying majority of the network, in a real-time fashion. Recently, network embedding has proven a powerful tool in learning the low-dimensional representations of vertices in networks that can capture and preserve the network structure. However, most existing network embedding approaches are designed for static networks, and thus may not be perfectly suited for a dynamic environment in which the network representation has to be constantly updated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, NetWalk, for anomaly detection in dynamic networks by learning network representations which can be updated dynamically as the network evolves. We first encode the vertices of the dynamic network to vector representations by clique embedding, which jointly minimizes the pairwise distance of vertex representations of each walk derived from the dynamic networks, and the deep autoencoder reconstruction error serving as a global regularization. The vector representations can be computed with constant space requirements using reservoir sampling. On the basis of the learned low-dimensional vertex representations, a clustering-based technique is employed to incrementally and dynamically detect network anomalies. Compared with existing approaches, NetWalk has several advantages: 1) the network embedding can be updated dynamically, 2) streaming network nodes and edges can be encoded efficiently with constant memory space usage, 3). flexible to be applied on different types of networks, and 4) network anomalies can be detected in real- time. Extensive experiments on four real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NetWalk.", "keywords": ["Anomaly detection", "dynamic network embedding", "deep autoencoder", "clique embedding"], "reference_count": 44, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Charu C Aggarwal. 2013.

As the networks evolve over times, the interactions among the nodes in networks make heterogeneous networks exhibit dynamic characteristics. However, almost all the existing heterogeneous network representation learning methods focus on static networks which ignore dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach DHNE to learn the representations of nodes in dynamic heterogeneous networks. The key idea of our approach is to construct comprehensive historical-current networks based on subgraphs of snapshots in time step to capture both the historical and current information in the dynamic heterogeneous network. And then under the guidance of meta paths, DHNE performs random walks on the constructed historical-current graphs to capture semantic information. After getting the node sequences through random walks, we propose the dynamic heterogeneous skip-gram model to learn the embeddings. Experiments on large-scale real-world networks demonstrate that the embeddings learned by the proposed DHNE model achieve better performances than state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks including node classification and visualization.", "keywords": ["Dynamic heterogeneous networks", "network representation learning", "random walk", "skip-gram model"], "reference_count": 29, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] C.

It has been proven extremely useful in many machine learning tasks over large graph. Most existing methods focus on learning the structural representations of vertices in a static network, but cannot guarantee an accurate and efficient embedding in a dynamic network scenario. The fundamental problem of continuously capturing the dynamic properties in an efficient way for a dynamic network remains unsolved. To address this issue, we present an efficient incremental skip-gram algorithm with negative sampling for dynamic network embedding, and provide a set of theoretical analyses to characterize the performance guarantee. Specifically, we first partition a dynamic network into the updated, including addition/deletion of links and vertices, and the retained networks over time. Then we factorize the objective function of network embedding into the added, vanished and retained parts of the network. Next we provide a new stochastic gradient-based method, guided by the partitions of the network, to update the nodes and the parameter vectors. The proposed algorithm is proven to yield an objective function value with a bounded difference to that of the original objective function. The first order moment of the objective difference converges in order of O( 1 ), and the second order moment of the n2 objective difference can be stabilized in order of O(1). Experimental results show that our proposal can significantly reduce the training time while preserving the comparable performance. We also demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the practical usefulness of the dynamic network embedding. We perform extensive experiments on multiple real-world large network datasets over multi-label classification and link prediction tasks to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework, and up to 22 times speedup has been achieved.", "keywords": ["Dynamic Network Embedding", "Bound and Convergence Analysis", "Multi-label Classification", "Link Prediction"], "reference_count": 45, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Shaosheng Cao, Wei Lu, and Qiongkai Xu.

In recent years, the concept of network embedding has attracted lots of attention to deal with various network analytic tasks, the purpose of which is to encode relationships or information of networked elements into a low-dimensional vector space. However, most existing embedding methods have focused mainly on preserving static network information, such as structural proximity, node/edge attributes, and labels. On the contrary, in this paper, we focus on the embedding problem of preserving dynamic characteristics of epidemic spreading on social networks.

Specifically, the Susceptible-Infectious model is adopted to simulate the epidemic dynamics on networks, and the Continuous Bag-of-Words model with negative sampling is used to obtain node representations. Experimental results show that the EpiRep method outperforms two benchmark random-walk based embedding methods in terms of node clustering and classification on several synthetic and real-world networks.

Most real-world networks are dynamic with addition/deletion of nodes and edges.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic embedding method, dynnode2vec, based on the well-known graph embedding method node2vec. Node2vec is a random walk based embedding method for static networks. Applying static network embedding in dynamic settings has two crucial problems: 1) Generating random walks for every time step is time consuming 2) Embedding vector spaces in each timestamp are different. In order to tackle these challenges, dynnode2vec uses evolving random walks and initializes the current graph embedding with previous embedding vectors. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed dynamic network embedding by conducting empirical evaluations on several large dynamic network datasets.", "keywords": ["None"], "reference_count": 23, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] S.

Among them, a large number of networks are not only topologically structured but also have a rich set of features on nodes. These node features are usually of high dimensionality with noisy, irrelevant and redundant in- formation, which may impede the performance of other learning tasks. Feature selection is useful to alleviate these critical issues. Nonetheless, a vast majority of existing feature selection algorithms are predominantly designed in a static setting. In reality, real-world networks are naturally dynamic, characterized by both topology and content changes. It is desirable to capture these changes to find relevant features tightly hinged with network structure continuously, which is of fundamental importance for many applications such as disaster relief and viral marketing. In this paper, we study a novel problem of time-evolving feature selection for dynamic networks in an unsupervised scenario. Specifically, we propose a TeFS framework by leveraging the temporal evolution property of dynamic networks to update the feature selection results incrementally. Experimental results show the superiority of TeFS over the state-of-the-art batch-mode unsupervised feature selection algorithms.", "keywords": ["unsupervised learning", "feature selection", "dynamic networks"], "reference_count": 23, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Charu Aggarwal and Karthik Subbian.

The proposed model is robust to noise and have the exponential capability to capture nonlinear variance. We tackle the computational challenges by developing an efficient algorithm for learning and inference of the proposed model.

Is it random? If not, what are the most apparent deviations from randomness -- a dense block of actors that persists over time, or perhaps a star with many satellite nodes that appears with some fixed periodicity? In practice, these deviations indicate patterns -- for example, botnet attackers forming a bipartite core with their victims over the duration of an attack, family members bonding in a clique-like fashion over a difficult period of time, or research collaborations forming and fading away over the years. Which patterns exist in real-world dynamic graphs, and how can we find and rank them in terms of importance? These are exactly the problems we focus on in this work. Our main contributions are (a) formulation: we show how to formalize this problem as minimizing the encoding cost in a data compression paradigm, (b) algorithm: we propose TIMECRUNCH, an effective, scalable and parameter-free method for finding coherent, temporal patterns in dynamic graphs and (c) practicality: we apply our method to several large, diverse real-world datasets with up to 36 million edges and 6.3 million nodes.

Most existing network embedding methods mainly focus on static networks, which extract and condense the network information without temporal information. However, in the real world, networks keep evolving, where the linkage states between the same vertex pairs at consequential timestamps have very close correlations. In this paper, we propose to study the network embedding problem and focus on modeling the linkage evolution in the dynamic network setting. To address this problem, we propose a deep dynamic network embedding method. More specifically, the method utilizes the historical information obtained from the network snapshots at past timestamps to learn latent representations of the future network. In the proposed embedding method, the objective function is carefully designed to incorporate both the network internal and network dynamic transition structures. Extensive empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed model on various categories of real-world networks, including a human contact network, a bibliographic network, and e-mail networks. Furthermore, the experimental results also demonstrate the significant advantages of the method compared with both the state-of-the-art embedding techniques and several existing baseline methods.", "keywords": ["Social network analysis", "network embedding", "link prediction", "deep learning."], "reference_count": 29, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] M.

Representation learning presents an attractive opportunity to model the dynamic evolution of users and items, where each user/item can be embedded in a Euclidean space and its evolution can be modeled by an embedding trajectory in this space. However, existing dynamic embedding methods generate embeddings only when users take actions and do not explicitly model the future trajectory of the user/item in the embedding space. Here we propose JODIE, a coupled recurrent neural network model that learns the embedding trajectories of users and items. JODIE employs two recurrent neural networks to update the embedding of a user and an item at every interaction. Crucially, JODIE also models the future embedding trajectory of a user/item. To this end, it introduces a novel projection operator that learns to estimate the embedding of the user at any time in the future. These estimated embeddings are then used to predict future user-item interactions. To make the method scalable, we develop a t-Batch algorithm that creates time-consistent batches and leads to 9x faster training. We conduct six experiments to validate JODIE on two prediction tasks---future interaction prediction and state change prediction---using four real-world datasets. We show that JODIE outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms in these tasks by at least 20% in predicting future interactions and 12% in state change prediction.", "keywords": ["Dynamic Embedding", "Temporal Interaction Networks"], "reference_count": 52, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Kdd cup 2015. https://biendata.com/competition/kddcup2015/data/."}, {"ref": "[2] Reddit data dump. http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/."}, {"ref": "[3] Wikipedia edit history dump. https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps."}, {"ref": "[4] D.

It is a key step in understanding the formation and evolution of the underlying networks; and has practical implications in many real-world applications, ranging from friendship recommendation, click through prediction to targeted advertising. Most existing efforts are devoted to plain networks and assume the availability of network structure in memory before link prediction takes place. However, this assumption is untenable as many real-world networks are affiliated with rich node attributes, and often, the network structure and node attributes are both dynamically evolving at an unprecedented rate. Even though recent studies show that node attributes have an added value to network structure for accurate link prediction, it still remains a daunting task to support link prediction in an online fashion on such dynamic attributed networks. As changes in the dynamic attributed networks are often transient and can be endless, link prediction algorithms need to be efficient by making only one pass of the data with limited memory overhead. To tackle these challenges, we study a novel problem of streaming link prediction on dynamic attributed networks and present a novel framework - SLIDE. Methodologically, SLIDE maintains and updates a low-rank sketching matrix to summarize all observed data, and we further leverage the sketching matrix to infer missing links on the fly. The whole procedure is theoretically guaranteed, and empirical experiments on real-world dynamic attributed networks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.", "keywords": ["Dynamic Attributed Networks\uff0cLink Prediction"], "reference_count": 57, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Charu Aggarwal and Karthik Subbian. 2014.

At present, most of the network embedding works are based on static networks, that is, the evolution of networks over time is not taken into account. It is more realistic to consider temporal information in network embedding and it could also make the embedding get more abundant information. In this paper, we propose a dynamic network embedding model DynSEM with semantic evolution, to train node embeddings in a sequence of networks over time. The advantage of our method is that it presents an effective inheritance of historical information. Our method uses nonrandom initialization and orthogonal procrustes method to align the node embeddings into common space which makes node embedding able to inheritance information. In particular, in the common space, we train a model to capture the dynamics information of the networks and smooth temporal node embeddings. We evaluate our method comparing it with other methods on three real-world datasets. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of dynamic network embeddings generated by DynSEM model.", "keywords": ["Dynamic Network", "Semantic Evolution", "Nonrandom Initialization", "Network Embedding"], "reference_count": 34, "ccfClass": "C", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Le-kui Zhou Yang Yang Xiang Ren Fei Wu Yueting Zhuang Dynamic Network Embedding by Modeling Triadic Closure Process AAAI pp. 571-578 2018."}, {"ref": "[2] B Perozzi R Alrfou S Skiena DeepWalk: online learning of social representations[J] pp. 701-710 2014."}, {"ref": "[3] A Grover J Leskovec node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks[J] vol. 2016 pp. 855-864 2016."}, {"ref": "[4] D Wang P Cui W Zhu \"Structural Deep Network Embedding[C]\" Acm Sigkdd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery &amp; Data Mining 2016."}, {"ref": "[5] Li J Dani H Hu X et al. \"Attributed network embedding for learning in a dynamic environment[C]\" Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management pp. 387-396 2017."}, {"ref": "[6] D Zhu P Cui Z Zhang et al. \"High-order Proximity Preserved Embedding For Dynamic Networks[J]\" IEEE Transactions on Knowledge &amp; Data Engineering vol.

How to infer embeddings for out-of-sample nodes, i.e. nodes that arrive after learning, remains an open problem. The problem poses great challenges to existing methods, since the inferred embeddings should preserve intricate network properties such as high-order proximity, share similar characteristics (i.e. be of a homogeneous space) with in-sample node embeddings, and be of low computational cost. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Deeply Transformed High-order Laplacian Gaussian Process (DepthLGP) method to infer embeddings for out-of-sample nodes. DepthLGP combines the strength of nonparametric probabilistic modeling and deep learning. In particular, we design a high-order Laplacian Gaussian process (hLGP) to encode network properties, which permits fast and scalable inference. In order to further ensure homogeneity, we then employ a deep neural network to learn a nonlinear transformation from latent states of the hLGP to node embeddings. DepthLGP is general, in that it is applicable to embeddings learned by any network embedding algorithms. We theoretically prove the expressive power of DepthLGP, and conduct extensive experiments on real-world networks. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant performance gain over existing approaches.", "keywords": ["None"], "reference_count": 40, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Belkin, M.; Niyogi, P.; and Sindhwani, V. 2006.

The algorithm is initialized using static node embeddings, which are then aligned over the representations of a node at different time points, and eventually adapted for the given task in a joint optimization. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over a variety of temporal graphs for the two fundamental tasks of temporal link prediction and multi-label node classification, comparing to competitive baselines and algorithmic alternatives.

Traditional approaches rely on measuring the similarity between two nodes in a static context. Recent research has focused on extending link prediction to a dynamic setting, predicting the creation and destruction of links in networks that evolve over time. Though a difficult task, the employment of deep learning techniques has shown to make notable improvements to the accuracy of predictions. To this end, we propose the novel application of weak estimators in addition to the utilization of traditional similarity metrics to inexpensively build an effective feature vector for a deep neural network. Weak estimators have been used in a variety of machine learning algorithms to improve model accuracy, owing to their capacity to estimate the changing probabilities in dynamic systems. Experiments indicate that our approach results in increased prediction accuracy on several real-world dynamic networks.", "keywords": ["Deep learning", "link prediction", "dynamic networks", "weak estimators", "similarity metrics"], "reference_count": 52, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] D.

The project extracts knowledge from 111 different language editions of Wikipedia.

The DBpedia knowledge bases that are extracted from the other 110 Wikipedia editions together consist of 1.46 billion facts and describe 10 million additional things. The DBpedia project maps Wikipedia infoboxes from 27 different language editions to a single shared ontology consisting of 320 classes and 1,650 properties. The mappings are created via a world-wide crowd-sourcing effort and enable knowledge from the different Wikipedia editions to be combined. The project publishes releases of all DBpedia knowledge bases for download and provides SPARQL query access to 14 out of the 111 language editions via a global network of local DBpedia chapters. In addition to the regular releases, the project maintains a live knowledge base which is updated whenever a page in Wikipedia changes. DBpedia sets 27 million RDF links pointing into over 30 external data sources and thus enables data from these sources to be used together with DBpedia data. Several hundred data sets on the Web publish RDF links pointing to DBpedia themselves and make DBpedia one of the central interlinking hubs in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud.

YAGO builds on entities and relations and currently contains more than 1 million entities and 5 million facts.

The facts have been automatically extracted from Wikipedia and unified with WordNet, using a carefully designed combination of rule-based and heuristic methods described in this paper. The resulting knowledge base is a major step beyond WordNet: in\u00a0quality\u00a0by adding knowledge about individuals like persons, organizations, products, etc. with their semantic relationships - and in\u00a0quantity\u00a0by increasing the number of facts by more than an order of magnitude. Our empirical evaluation of fact correctness shows an accuracy of about 95%. YAGO is based on a logically clean model, which is decidable, extensible, and compatible with RDFS. Finally, we show how YAGO can be further extended by state-of-the-art information extraction techniques.", "keywords": ["Wikipedia", "WordNet"], "reference_count": 28, "ccf_class": "A", "is_important": 1.0, "references": [{"ref": "E.

Promising progress has recently been achieved by methods that learn to map questions to logical forms or database queries. Such approaches can be effective but at the cost of either large amounts of human-labeled data or by defining lexicons and grammars tailored by practitioners. In this paper, we instead take the radical approach of learning to map questions to vectorial feature representations. By mapping answers into the same space one can query any knowledge base independent of its schema, without requiring any grammar or lexicon. Our method is trained with a new optimization procedure combining stochastic gradient descent followed by a fine-tuning step using the weak supervision provided by blending automatically and collaboratively generated resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model can capture meaningful signals from its noisy supervision leading to major improvements over\u00a0paralex, the only existing method able to be trained on similar weakly labeled data.", "keywords": ["natural language processing", "\u00a0question answering", "\u00a0weak supervision", "\u00a0embedding models\u00a0"], "reference_count": 26, "ccf_class": "B", "is_important": "", "references": [{"ref": "Banko, M., Brill, E., Dumais, S., Lin, J.: Askmsr: Question answering using the worldwide web.

TransE is a promising method proposed recently, which is very efficient while achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. We discuss some mapping properties of relations which should be considered in embedding, such as reflexive, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. We note that TransE does not do well in dealing with these properties. Some complex models are capable of preserving these mapping properties but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between model capacity and efficiency, in this paper we propose TransH which models a relation as a hyperplane together with a translation operation on it. In this way, we can well preserve the above mapping properties of relations with almost the same model complexity of TransE. Additionally, as a practical knowledge graph is often far from completed, how to construct negative examples to reduce false negative labels in training is very important. Utilizing the one-to-many/many-to-one mapping property of a relation, we propose a simple trick to reduce the possibility of false negative labeling. We conduct extensive experiments on link prediction, triplet classification and fact extraction on benchmark datasets like WordNet and Freebase.

In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities.

The goal of this paper is to develop a more powerful neural network model suitable for inference over these relationships. Previous models suffer from weak interaction between entities or simple linear projection of the vector space. We address these problems by introducing a neural tensor network (NTN) model which allow the entities and relations to interact multiplicatively. Additionally, we observe that such knowledge base models can be further improved by representing each entity as the average of vectors for the words in the entity name, giving an additional dimension of similarity by which entities can share statistical strength. We assess the model by considering the problem of predicting additional true relations between entities given a partial knowledge base.

Machine learning approaches to this task require either manual annotation or, in the case of distant supervision, existing structured sources of the same schema. The need for existing datasets can be avoided by using a universal schema: the union of all involved schemas (surface form predicates as in OpenIE, and relations in the schemas of preexisting databases). This schema has an almost unlimited set of relations (due to surface forms), and supports integration with existing structured data (through the relation types of existing databases). To populate a database of such schema we present matrix factorization models that learn latent feature vectors for entity tuples and relations. We show that such latent models achieve substantially higher accuracy than a traditional classification approach. More importantly, by operating simultaneously on relations observed in text and in pre-existing structured DBs such as Freebase, we are able to reason about unstructured and structured data in mutually-supporting ways. By doing so our approach outperforms stateof-the-art distant supervision.", "keywords": [""], "reference_count": 33, "ccf_class": "C", "is_important": "", "references": [{"ref": "Ronald J.

Most existing methods only concentrate on learning representations with structured information located in triples, regardless of the rich information located in hierarchical types of entities, which could be collected in most knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Type-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning (TKRL) to take advantages of hierarchical entity types. We suggest that entities should have multiple representations in different types. More specifically, we consider hierarchical types as projection matrices for entities, with two type encoders designed to model hierarchical structures. Meanwhile, type information is also utilized as relation-specific type constraints. We evaluate our models on two tasks including knowledge graph completion and triple classification, and further explore the performances on long-tail dataset. Experimental results show that our models significantly outperform all baselines on both tasks, especially with long-tail distribution. It indicates that our models are capable of capturing hierarchical type information which is significant when constructing representations of knowledge graphs.

However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts (edges) which disrupts path queries. Recent models for knowledge base completion impute missing facts by embedding knowledge graphs in vector spaces. We show that these models can be recursively applied to answer path queries, but that they suffer from cascading errors. This motivates a new \"compositional\" training objective, which dramatically improves all models' ability to answer path queries, in some cases more than doubling accuracy. On a standard knowledge base completion task, we also demonstrate that compositional training acts as a novel form of structural regularization, reliably improving performance across all base models (reducing errors by up to 43%) and achieving new state-of-the-art results.", "keywords": [""], "reference_count": 26, "ccf_class": "B", "is_important": "", "references": [{"ref": "F.

By regarding each relation as one translation from head entity to tail entity, translation-based methods including TransE, TransH and TransR are simple, effective and achieving the state-of-the-art performance. However, they still suffer the following issues: (i) low performance when modeling 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N relations. (ii) limited performance due to the structure sparseness of the knowledge graph. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph representation learning method by taking advantage of the rich context information in a text corpus. The rich textual context information is incorporated to expand the semantic structure of the knowledge graph and each relation is enabled to own different representations for different head and tail entities to better handle 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N relations. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed method successfully addresses the above issues and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.", "keywords": [""], "reference_count": 17, "ccf_class": "A", "is_important": "", "references": [{"ref": "Kurt Bollacker , Colin Evans , Praveen Paritosh , Tim Sturge , Jamie Taylor, Freebase: a collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge, Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data, June 09-12, 2008, Vancouver, Canada"}, {"ref": "Antoine Bordes , Nicolas Usunier , Alberto Garcia-Dur\u00e1n , Jason Weston , Oksana Yakhnenko, Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data, Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, p.2787-2795, December 05-10, 2013, Lake Tahoe, Nevada"}, {"ref": "Paolo Ferragina , Ugo Scaiella, TAGME: on-the-fly annotation of short text fragments (by wikipedia entities), Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management, October 26-30, 2010, Toronto, ON, Canada"}, {"ref": "Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Huan-Bo Luan, Maosong Sun, Siwei Rao, and Song Liu.

Most existing methods perform the embedding task using only fact triples. Logical rules, although containing rich background information, have not been well studied in this task. This paper proposes a novel method of jointly embedding knowledge graphs and logical rules. The key idea is to represent and model triples and rules in a unified framework. Specifically, triples are represented as atomic formulae and modeled by the translation assumption, while rules represented as complex formulae and modeled by t-norm fuzzy logics. Embedding then amounts to minimizing a global loss over both atomic and complex formulae. In this manner, we learn embeddings compatible not only with triples but also with rules, which will certainly be more predictive for knowledge acquisition and inference. We evaluate our method with link prediction and triple classification tasks. Experimental results show that joint embedding brings significant and consistent improvements over stateof-the-art methods. Particularly, it enhances the prediction of new facts which cannot even be directly inferred by pure logical inference, demonstrating the capability of our method to learn more predictive embeddings.", "keywords": [""], "reference_count": 39, "ccf_class": "B", "is_important": "", "references": [{"ref": "Islam Beltagy and Raymond J.

Unfortunately , these methods share a shortcoming with all other distantly supervised approaches: they cannot learn to extract target relations without existing data in the knowledge base, and likewise, these models are inaccurate for relations with sparse data. Rule-based extractors, on the other hand, can be easily extended to novel relations and improved for existing but inaccurate relations, through first-order formu-lae that capture auxiliary domain knowledge. However, usually a large set of such formulae is necessary to achieve generalization. In this paper, we introduce a paradigm for learning low-dimensional embeddings of entity-pairs and relations that combine the advantages of matrix factorization with first-order logic domain knowledge. We introduce simple approaches for estimating such embeddings, as well as a novel training algorithm to jointly optimize over factual and first-order logic information. Our results show that this method is able to learn accurate extractors with little or no distant supervision alignments, while at the same time generalizing to textual patterns that do not appear in the formulae.", "keywords": [""], "reference_count": 49, "ccf_class": "C", "is_important": "", "references": [{"ref": "Yaser S Abu-Mostafa. 1990.

To this end, some proposed models (e.g., TransE) embed entities and relations of a KG into a \"point\" vector space by optimizing a global loss function which ensures the scores of positive triplets are higher than negative ones. We notice that these models always regard all entities and relations in a same manner and ignore their (un)certainties. In fact, different entities and relations may contain different certainties, which makes identical certainty insufficient for modeling. Therefore, this paper switches to\u00a0density-based\u00a0embedding and propose\u00a0KG2E\u00a0for explicitly modeling the certainty of entities and relations, which learn the representations of KGs in the space of multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions. Each entity/relation is represented by a Gaussian distribution, where the mean denotes its position and the covariance (currently with diagonal covariance) can properly represent its certainty. In addition, compared with the symmetric measures used in\u00a0point-based\u00a0methods, we employ the KL-divergence for scoring triplets, which is a natural asymmetry function for effectively modeling multiple types of relations. We have conducted extensive experiments on link prediction and triplet classification with multiple benchmark datasets (WordNet and Freebase). Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively model the (un)certainties of entities and relations in a KG, and it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (including TransH and TransR).", "keywords": ["Distributed Representation", "Gaussian Embedding", "Knowledge Graph"], "reference_count": 32, "ccf_class": "B", "is_important": 1.0, "references": [{"ref": "K.

Existing methods, e.g., TransE and TransH, learn embedding representation by defining a global margin-based loss function over the data. However, the optimal loss function is determined during experiments whose parameters are examined among a closed set of candidates. Moreover, embeddings over two knowledge graphs with different entities and relations share the same set of candidate loss functions, ignoring the locality of both graphs. This leads to the limited performance of embedding related applications. In this paper, we propose a locally adaptive translation method for knowledge graph embedding, called TransA, to find the optimal loss function by adaptively determining its margin over different knowledge graphs.

In this paper, we discuss that graph structures should be considered in embedding and propose to embed substructures called \u201cone-relation-circle\u201d (ORC) to further improve the performance of the above methods as they are unable to encode ORC substructures. Some complex models are capable of handling ORC structures but sacrifice efficiency in the process. To make a good trade-off between the model capacity and efficiency, we propose a method to decompose ORC substructures by using two vectors to represent the entity as a head or tail entity with the same relation. In this way, we can encode the ORC structure properly when apply it to TransH, TransR and TransD with almost the same model complexity of themselves. We conduct experiments on link prediction with benchmark dataset WordNet.

However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts. To populate the graphs, knowledge graph embedding models have been developed. Knowledge graph embedding models map entities and relations in a knowledge graph to a vector space and predict unknown triples by scoring candidate triples. TransE is the first translation-based method and it is well known because of its simplicity and efficiency for knowledge graph completion. It employs the principle that the differences between entity embeddings represent their relations. The principle seems very simple, but it can effectively capture the rules of a knowledge graph. However, TransE has a problem with its regularization. TransE forces entity embeddings to be on a sphere in the embedding vector space. This regularization warps the embeddings and makes it difficult for them to fulfill the abovementioned principle. The regularization also affects adversely the accuracies of the link predictions. On the other hand, regularization is important because entity embeddings diverge by negative sampling without it. This paper proposes a novel embedding model, TorusE, to solve the regularization problem. The principle of TransE can be defined on any Lie group. A torus, which is one of the compact Lie groups, can be chosen for the embedding space to avoid regularization. To the best of our knowledge, TorusE is the first model that embeds objects on other than a real or complex vector space, and this paper is the first to formally discuss the problem of regularization of TransE. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as TransE, DistMult and ComplEx on a standard link prediction task. We show that TorusE is scalable to large-size knowledge graphs and is faster than the original TransE.", "keywords": ["knowledge graph; knowledge inference"], "reference_count": 22, "ccf_class": "A", "is_important": "", "references": [{"ref": "Angeli, G.; Premkumar, M.

Early works performed this task via simple models developed over KG triples. Recent attempts focused on either designing more complicated triple scoring models, or incorporating extra information beyond triples. This paper, by contrast, investigates the potential of using very simple constraints to improve KG embedding. We examine non-negativity constraints on entity representations and approximate entailment constraints on relation representations. The former help to learn compact and interpretable representations for entities. The latter further encode regularities of logical entailment between relations into their distributed representations. These constraints impose prior beliefs upon the structure of the embedding space, without negative impacts on efficiency or scalability. Evaluation on WordNet, Freebase, and DBpedia shows that our approach is simple yet surprisingly effective, significantly and consistently outperforming competitive baselines. The constraints imposed indeed improve model interpretability, leading to a substantially increased structuring of the embedding space.

Combining such an embedding model with logic rules has recently attracted increasing attention. Most previous attempts made a one-time injection of logic rules, ignoring the interactive nature between embedding learning and logical inference. And they focused only on hard rules, which always hold with no exception and usually require extensive manual effort to create or validate. In this paper, we propose Rule-Guided Embedding (RUGE), a novel paradigm of KG embedding with iterative guidance from soft rules. RUGE enables an embedding model to learn simultaneously from 1) labeled triples that have been directly observed in a given KG, 2) unlabeled triples whose labels are going to be predicted iteratively, and 3) soft rules with various confidence levels extracted automatically from the KG. In the learning process, RUGE iteratively queries rules to obtain soft labels for unlabeled triples, and integrates such newly labeled triples to update the embedding model. Through this iterative procedure, knowledge embodied in logic rules may be better transferred into the learned embeddings. We evaluate RUGE in link prediction on Freebase and YAGO. Experimental results show that: 1) with rule knowledge injected iteratively, RUGE achieves significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines; and 2) despite their uncertainties, automatically extracted soft rules are highly beneficial to KG embedding, even those with moderate confidence levels.

It aims to encode the entities and relations in the graph into low dimensional vector space, which can be used for subsequent algorithms. Negative sampling, which samples negative triplets from non-observed ones in the training data, is an important step in KG embedding. Recently, generative adversarial network (GAN), has been introduced in negative sampling. By sampling negative triplets with large scores, these methods avoid the problem of vanishing gradient and thus obtain better performance. However, using GAN makes the original model more complex and harder to train, where reinforcement learning must be used. In this paper, motivated by the observation that negative triplets with large scores are important but rare, we propose to directly keep track of them with cache. However, how to sample from and update the cache are two important questions. We carefully design the solutions, which are not only efficient but also achieve good balance between exploration and exploitation. In this way, our method acts as a 'distilled' version of previous GAN-based methods, which does not waste training time on additional parameters to fit the full distribution of negative triplets. The extensive experiments show that our method can gain significant improvement on various KG embedding models, and outperform the state-of-the-arts negative sampling methods based on GAN.", "keywords": [""], "reference_count": 44, "ccf_class": "A", "is_important": "", "references": [{"ref": "M.

However, it is not yet well-understood to what extent ontological knowledge, e.g. given as a set of (existential) rules, can be embedded in a principled way. To address this shortcoming, in this paper we introduce a general framework based on a view of relations as regions, which allows us to study the compatibility between ontological knowledge and different types of vector space embeddings. Our technical contribution is two-fold. First, we show that some of the most popular existing embedding methods are not capable of modelling even very simple types of rules, which in particular also means that they are not able to learn the type of dependencies captured by such rules. Second, we study a model in which relations are modelled as convex regions. We show particular that ontologies which are expressed using so-called quasi-chained existential rules can be exactly represented using convex regions, such that any set of facts which is induced using that vector space embedding is logically consistent and deductively closed with respect to the input ontology.", "keywords": [""], "reference_count": 40, "ccf_class": "A", "is_important": "", "references": [{"ref": "Baader, F.; Horrocks, I.; Lutz, C.; and Sattler, U. 2017.

The cross-view association model is learned to bridge the embeddings of ontological concepts and their corresponding instance-view entities. The intra-view models are trained to capture the structured knowledge of instance and ontology views in separate embedding spaces, with a hierarchy-aware encoding technique enabled for ontologies with hierarchies. We explore multiple representation techniques for the two model components and investigate with nine variants of JOIE. Our model is trained on large-scale knowledge bases that consist of massive instances and their corresponding ontological concepts connected via a (small) set of cross-view links.

Experimental results on several popular datasets derived from WordNet, FreeBase and ConceptNet have all demonstrated that both DNNs and RMNNs perform equally well and they can significantly outperform the conventional methods available for these reasoning tasks. Moreover, compared with DNNs, RMNNs are superior in knowledge transfer, where a pre-trained model can be quickly extended to an unseen relation after observing only a few training samples.

In this paper we use the concept of a knowledge graph to present information about specific classes of entities, such as patients or users. The knowledge graph represents all that is known about the entities and their relationships and the goal is to integrate and exploit that information for prediction and decision support. In previous papers it was shown that embedding learning, a.k.a. representation learning, is capable of modelling large-scale semantic knowledge graphs, by exploiting information that describes the context of an entity in the knowledge graph. In Machine Learning we often map the knowledge graph to a tensor representation. Then we learn the latent representations of the entities that compose the tensor and use them to predict unobserved facts. However knowledge graphs represent the current status of the world and therefore they lack of a temporal dimension, which means we can only use them to predict facts about the present moment. In this paper we introduce an additional set of tensors that contain temporal information. Each of this event tensors contains all the events that occurred on a particular time step. Our goal will be to predict the events that will happen in future time steps, using for that task both dynamic information from the previous event tensors and static information that is stored in the knowledge graph. Therefore, this architecture allows us to fuse static and dynamic information to predict future events.

Due to the rapid collection of information on the web, the knowledge base provides heterogeneous information including both structured and unstructured data with different semantics, which can be consumed by various applications. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage the heterogeneous information in a knowledge base to improve the quality of recommender systems. First, by exploiting the knowledge base, we design three components to extract items' semantic representations from structural content, textual content and visual content, respectively. To be specific, we adopt a heterogeneous network embedding method, termed as TransR, to extract items' structural representations by considering the heterogeneity of both nodes and relationships. We apply stacked denoising auto-encoders and stacked convolutional auto-encoders, which are two types of deep learning based embedding techniques, to extract items' textual representations and visual representations, respectively. Finally, we propose our final integrated framework, which is termed as Collaborative Knowledge Base Embedding (CKE), to jointly learn the latent representations in collaborative filtering as well as items' semantic representations from the knowledge base. To evaluate the performance of each embedding component as well as the whole system, we conduct extensive experiments with two real-world datasets from different scenarios.

In order to still enjoy the benefit brought by the graph structure while preventing dilution of knowledge from distant nodes, we propose a Dense Graph Propagation (DGP) module with carefully designed direct links among distant nodes. DGP allows us to exploit the hierarchical graph structure of the knowledge graph through additional connections. These connections are added based on a node's relationship to its ancestors and descendants.

Traditional methods like factorization machine (FM) cast it as a supervised learning problem, which assumes each interaction as an independent instance with side information encoded. Due to the overlook of the relations among instances or items (e.g., the director of a movie is also an actor of another movie), these methods are insufficient to distill the collaborative signal from the collective behaviors of users. In this work, we investigate the utility of knowledge graph (KG), which breaks down the independent interaction assumption by linking items with their attributes. We argue that in such a hybrid structure of KG and user-item graph, high-order relations --- which connect two items with one or multiple linked attributes --- are an essential factor for successful recommendation. We propose a new method named Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) which explicitly models the high-order connectivities in KG in an end-to-end fashion. It recursively propagates the embeddings from a node's neighbors (which can be users, items, or attributes) to refine the node's embedding, and employs an attention mechanism to discriminate the importance of the neighbors. Our KGAT is conceptually advantageous to existing KG-based recommendation methods, which either exploit high-order relations by extracting paths or implicitly modeling them with regularization. Empirical results on three public benchmarks show that KGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Neural FM and RippleNet.

Conceptually, KGCN computes user-specific item embeddings by first applying a trainable function that identifies important knowledge graph relations for a given user and then transforming the knowledge graph into a user-specific weighted graph. Then, KGCN applies a graph convolutional neural network that computes an embedding of an item node by propagating and aggregating knowledge graph neighborhood information. Moreover, to provide better inductive bias KGCN uses label smoothness (LS), which provides regularization over edge weights and we prove that it is equivalent to label propagation scheme on a graph. Finally, We unify KGCN and LS regularization, and present a scalable minibatch implementation for KGCN-LS model. Experiments show that KGCN-LS outperforms strong baselines in four datasets.

In multiple partially aligned social networks, users can be extensively correlated with each other by various connections. To categorize these diverse connections among users, 7 \"intra-network social meta paths\" and 4 categories of \"inter-network social meta paths\" are proposed in this paper. These \"social meta paths\" can cover a wide variety of connection information in the network, some of which can be helpful for solving the multi-network link prediction problem but some can be not. To utilize useful connection, a subset of the most informative \"social meta paths\" are picked, the process of which is formally defined as \"social meta path selection\" in this paper. An effective general link formation prediction framework, Mli (Multi-network Link Identifier), is proposed in this paper to solve the multi-network link (formation) prediction problem. Built with heterogenous topological features extracted based on the selected \"social meta paths\" in the multiple partially aligned social networks, Mli can help refine and disambiguate the prediction results reciprocally in all aligned networks.

In recent years, more and more online application service sites can be represented as massive and complex networks, which are extremely challenging for traditional machine learning algorithms to deal with. Effective embedding of the complex network data into low-dimension feature representation can both save data storage space and enable traditional machine learning algorithms applicable to handle the network data. Network embedding performance will degrade greatly if the networks are of a sparse structure, like the emerging networks with few connections. In this paper, we propose to learn the embedding representation for a target emerging network based on the broad learning setting, where the emerging network is aligned with other external mature networks at the same time. To solve the problem, a new embedding framework, namely \"Deep alIgned autoencoder based eMbEdding\" (DIME), is introduced in this paper. DIME handles the diverse link and attribute in a unified analytic based on broad learning, and introduces the multiple aligned attributed heterogeneous social network concept to model the network structure. A set of meta paths are introduced in the paper, which define various kinds of connections among users via the heterogeneous link and attribute information. The closeness among users in the networks are defined as the meta proximity scores, which will be fed into DIME to learn the embedding vectors of users in the emerging network. Extensive experiments have been done on real-world aligned social networks, which have demonstrated the effectiveness of DIME in learning the emerging network embedding vectors.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "", "references": [], "title": "Social Network Fusion and Mining: A Survey", "journal": "Computer Science > Social and Information Networks", "keywords": ["Broad Learning", "Heterogeneous Social Networks", "Network Alignment", "Link Prediction", "Community Detection", "Information Diffusion", "Network Embedding", "Data Mining"], "author": ["Jiawei Zhang"], "month": 4, "year": 2018, "reference_count": 151, "DOI": "2018arXiv180409874Z", "citations(google scholar)": 6, "abstract": "Looking from a global perspective, the landscape of online social networks is highly fragmented. A large number of online social networks have appeared, which can provide users with various types of services. Generally, the information available in these online social networks is of diverse categories, which can be represented as heterogeneous social networks (HSN) formally. Meanwhile, in such an age of online social media, users usually participate in multiple online social networks simultaneously to enjoy more social networks services, who can act as bridges connecting different networks together. So multiple HSNs not only represent information in single network, but also fuse information from multiple networks. Formally, the online social networks sharing common users are named as the aligned social networks, and these shared users who act like anchors aligning the networks are called the anchor users. The heterogeneous information generated by users' social activities in the multiple aligned social networks provides social network practitioners and researchers with the opportunities to study individual user's social behaviors across multiple social platforms simultaneously.

LBSNs usually have complex structures, involving heterogeneous nodes and links. Many recommendation services in LBSNs (e.g., friend and location recommendation) can be cast as link prediction problems (e.g., social link and location link prediction). Traditional link prediction researches on LBSNs mostly focus on predicting either social links or location links, assuming the prediction tasks of different types of links to be independent. However, in many real-world LBSNs, the prediction tasks for social links and location links are strongly correlated and mutually influential. Another key challenge in link prediction on LBSNs is the data sparsity problem (i.e., \"new network\" problem), which can be encountered when LBSNs branch into new geographic areas or social groups. Actually, nowadays, many users are involved in multiple networks simultaneously and users who just join one LBSN may have been using other LBSNs for a long time. In this paper, we study the problem of predicting multiple types of links simultaneously for a new LBSN across partially aligned LBSNs and propose a novel method TRAIL (TRAnsfer heterogeneous lInks across LBSNs). TRAIL can accumulate information for locations from online posts and extract heterogeneous features for both social links and location links. TRAIL can predict multiple types of links simultaneously. In addition, TRAIL can transfer information from other aligned networks to the new network to solve the problem of lacking information. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world aligned LBSNs show that TRAIL can achieve very good performance and substantially outperform the baseline methods.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "B", "references": [{"ref": "[1]\tL.

Nowadays, people are usually involved in multiple social networks simultaneously. The multiple accounts of the same user in different networks are mostly isolated from each other without any connection between them. Discovering the correspondence of these accounts across multiple social networks is a crucial prerequisite for many interesting inter-network applications, such as link recommendation and community analysis using information from multiple networks. In this paper, we study the problem of anchor link prediction across multiple heterogeneous social networks, i.e., discovering the correspondence among different accounts of the same user. Unlike most prior work on link prediction and network alignment, we assume that the anchor links are one-to-one relationships (i.e., no two edges share a common endpoint) between the accounts in two social networks, and a small number of anchor links are known beforehand. We propose to extract heterogeneous features from multiple heterogeneous networks for anchor link prediction, including user's social, spatial, temporal and text information. Then we formulate the inference problem for anchor links as a stable matching problem between the two sets of user accounts in two different networks. An effective solution, MNA (Multi-Network Anchoring), is derived to infer anchor links w.r.t. the one-to-one constraint. Extensive experiments on two real-world heterogeneous social networks show that our MNA model consistently outperform other commonly-used baselines on anchor link prediction.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "", "references": [{"ref": "[1]\tJ.

Due to the protection of privacy and the separation of different networks, the multiple accounts of the same user in different social networks are generally isolated. Finding the correspondence between users can benefit a variety of applications, such as cross-network recommendation and cold start. In this paper, we focus on inferring the correspondence between user pairs across partially aligned networks where some common users are shared, which is formally defined as multi-network anchor link inference problem. To solve the problem, an integrated anchor link inference framework, MALI (multi-network anchor link inference) is proposed, which consists of two parts: firstly, building structure-rich probabilistic networks with PU link prediction model to against noises. Secondly, taking advantage of cross-network social meta path as a powerful tool to extract useful features to train a classifier. Then by incorporating username with the ranking list which is based on the output probability of the classifier, an improved stable match model is designed to infer anchor links which are restricted to one-to-one relationships. Extensive experiments on two real-world partially aligned heterogeneous networks show that our proposed MALI can solve the multi-network anchor link inference problem very well.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "A", "references": [{"ref": "[1]\tYuxiao Dong , Jie Tang , Sen Wu , Jilei Tian , Nitesh V.

We solve both the network embedding problem and the user alignment problem simultaneously under a unified optimization framework.

Regardless the great volume of these datasets, their different nature (i.e. schema) deters the analysts from combining the datasets, losing insights of a location that could be important. In this study, we propose a framework that targets to achieve a knowledge fusion by connecting datasets of different nature. In order to achieve the fusion, we initially transform the datasets into graph bases. Afterwards, we import the graph bases into a knowledge base represented as Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN), using the location as the main node type that connects the datasets.

Latent factor models have been widely used for recommendation. Most existing latent factor models mainly utilize the interaction information between users and items, although some recently extended models utilize some auxiliary information to learn a unified latent factor for users and items. The unified latent factor only represents the characteristics of users and the properties of items from the aspect of purchase history. However, the characteristics of users and the properties of items may stem from different aspects, e.g., the brand-aspect and category-aspect of items. Moreover, the latent factor models usually use the shallow projection, which cannot capture the characteristics of users and items well. Deep neural network has shown tremendous potential to model the non-linearity relationship between users and items. It can be used to replace shallow projection to model the complex correlation between users and items. In this paper, we propose a Neural network based Aspect-level Collaborative Filtering model (NeuACF) to exploit different aspect latent factors. Through modelling the rich object properties and relations in recommender system as a heterogeneous information network, NeuACF first extracts different aspect-level similarity matrices of users and items, respectively, through different meta-paths, and then feeds an elaborately designed deep neural network with these matrices to learn aspect-level latent factors. Finally, the aspect-level latent factors are fused for the top-N recommendation. Moreover, to fuse information from different aspects more effectively, we further propose NeuACF++ to fuse aspect-level latent factors with self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on three real world datasets show that NeuACF and NeuACF++ significantly outperform both existing latent factor models and recent neural network models.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "", "references": [{"ref": "[1] Shaosheng Cao, Wei Lu, and Qiongkai Xu. 2015.

Meta path, which connects different object types with various semantic meanings, is widely used by existing HIN embedding works. However, several challenges have not been addressed so far. First, different meta paths convey different semantic meanings, while existing works assume that all nodes share same weights for meta paths and ignore the personalized preferences ofdifferent nodes on different meta paths. Second, given a meta path, nodes in HIN are connected by path instances while existing works fail to fully explore the differences between path instances that reflect nodes\u2019 preferences in the semantic space. rTo tackle the above challenges, we propose aHierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous information network Embedding (HAHE) model to capture the personalized preferences on meta paths and path instances in each semantic space. As path instances are based on a particular meta path, a hierarchical attention mechanism is naturally utilized to model the personalized preference on meta paths and path instances.

However, most of existing heterogenous information network embedding models adopt the dot product to measure the proximity in the low dimensional space, and thus they can only preserve the first-order proximity and are insufficient to capture the global structure. Compared with homogenous information networks, there are multiple types of links (i.e., multiple relations) in HINs, and the link distribution w.r.t relations is highly skewed. To address the above challenging issues, we propose a novel heterogenous information network embedding model PME based on the metric learning to capture both first-order and second-order proximities in a unified way. To alleviate the potential geometrical inflexibility of existing metric learning approaches, we propose to build object and relation embeddings in separate object space and relation spaces rather than in a common space. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by firstly projecting vertices from object space to corresponding relation space and then calculate the proximity between projected vertices. To overcome the heavy skewness of the link distribution w.r.t relations and avoid \u201cover-sampling\u201d or \u201cunder-sampling\u201d for each relation, we propose a novel loss-aware adaptive sampling approach for the model optimization.

Existing network embedding methods mainly focus on networks with pairwise relationships. In real world, however, the relationships among data points could go beyond pairwise, i.e., three or more objects are involved in each relationship represented by a hyperedge, thus forming hyper-networks. These hyper-networks pose great challenges to existing network embedding methods when the hyperedges are indecomposable, that is to say, any subset of nodes in a hyperedge cannot form another hyperedge. These indecomposable hyperedges are especially common in heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Hyper-Network Embedding (DHNE) model to embed hypernetworks with indecomposable hyperedges. More specifically, we theoretically prove that any linear similarity metric in embedding space commonly used in existing methods cannot maintain the indecomposibility property in hypernetworks, and thus propose a new deep model to realize a non-linear tuplewise similarity function while preserving both local and global proximities in the formed embedding space. We conduct extensive experiments on four different types of hyper-networks, including a GPS network, an online social network, a drug network and a semantic network. The empirical results demonstrate that our method can significantly and consistently outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "B", "references": [{"ref": "[1] Mikhail Belkin and Partha Niyogi. 2001.

Predicting the sign of sentiment links is a fundamental task in many areas such as personal advertising and public opinion analysis. Previous works mainly focus on textual sentiment classification, however, text information can only disclose the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d about users\u2019 true opinions, of which the most are unobserved but implied by other sources of information such as social relation and users\u2019 profile. To address this problem, in this paper we investigate how to predict possibly existing sentiment links in the presence of heterogeneous information. First, due to the lack of explicit sentiment links in mainstream social networks, we establish a labeled heterogeneous sentiment dataset which consists of users\u2019 sentiment relation, social relation and profile knowledge by entity-level sentiment extraction method. Then we propose a novel and flexible end-to-end Signed Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding (SHINE) framework to extract users\u2019 latent representations from heterogeneous networks and predict the sign of unobserved sentiment links. SHINE utilizes multiple deep autoencoders to map each user into a low-dimension feature space while preserving the network structure. We demonstrate the superiority of SHINE over state-of-the-art baselines on link prediction and node recommendation in two real-world datasets. The experimental results also prove the efficacy of SHINE in cold start scenario.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "B", "references": [{"ref": "[1] P. Auer, N. Cesa-Bianchi, and P. Fischer.

This paper focuses on learning node representations for heterogeneous star networks, which have a center node type linked with multiple attribute node types through di\ufffferent types of edges. In heterogeneous star networks, we observe that the training order of di\ufffferent types of edges a\uffffects the learning performance signi\uffffcantly. Therefore we study learning curricula for node representation learning in heterogeneous star networks, i.e., learning an optimal sequence of edges of di\ufffferent types for the node representation learning process. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, with the action as selecting a speci\uffffc type ofedges for learning or terminating the training process, and the state as the sequence of edge types selected so far. The reward is calculated as the performance on external tasks with node representations as features, and the goal is to take a series of actions to maximize the cumulative rewards. We propose an approach based on deep reinforcement learning for this problem. Our approach leverages LSTM models to encode states and further estimate the expected cumulative reward of each state-action pair, which essentially measures the long-term performance of di\ufffferent actions at each state.

A popular way to facilitate the information in a network is to embed the network structure into low-dimension spaces where each node is represented as a vector. The learned representations have been proven to advance various network analysis tasks such as link prediction and node classification. The majority of existing embedding algorithms are designed for the networks with one type of nodes and one dimension of relations among nodes. However, many networks in the real-world complex systems have multiple types of nodes and multiple dimensions of relations. For example, an e-commerce network can have users and items, and items can be viewed or purchased by users, corresponding to two dimensions of relations. In addition, some types of nodes can present hierarchical structure. For example, authors in publication networks are associated to affiliations; and items in e-commerce networks belong to categories. Most of existing methods cannot be naturally applicable to these networks. In this paper, we aim to learn representations for networks with multiple dimensions and hierarchical structure. In particular, we provide an approach to capture independent information from each dimension and dependent information across dimensions and propose a framework MINES, which performs Multi-dImension Network Embedding with hierarchical Structure. Experimental results on a network from a real-world e-commerce website demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "A", "references": [{"ref": "[1] Sami Abu-El-Haija, Bryan Perozzi, and Rami Al-Rfou. 2017.

In the meantime, network embedding has emerged as a convenient tool to mine and learn from networked data. As a result, it is ofinterest to develop HIN embedding methods. However, the heterogeneity in HINs introduces not only rich information but also potentially incompatible semantics, which poses special challenges to embedding learning in HINs. With the intention to preserve the rich yet potentially incompatible information in HIN embedding, we propose to study the problem of comprehensive transcription of heterogeneous information networks. The comprehensive transcription of HINs also provides an easy-to-use approach to unleash the power of HINs, since it requires no additional supervision, expertise, or feature engineering. To cope with the challenges in the comprehensive transcription of HINs, we propose the HEER algorithm, which embeds HINs via edge representations that are further coupled with properly-learned heterogeneous metrics. To corroborate the efficacy of HEER, we conducted experiments on two large-scale real-words datasets with an edge reconstruction task and multiple case studies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HEER model and the utility of edge representations and heterogeneous metrics.

First, all the existing methods can only preserve fixed-order proximities, despite that proximities of different orders are often desired for distinct networks and target applications. Second, given a certain order proximity, the existing methods cannot guarantee accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose AROPE (arbitrary-order proximity preserved embedding), a novel network embedding method based on SVD framework. We theoretically prove the eigen-decomposition reweighting theorem, revealing the intrinsic relationship between proximities of different orders. With this theorem, we propose a scalable eigen-decomposition solution to derive the embedding vectors and shift them between proximities of arbitrary orders. Theoretical analysis is provided to guarantee that i) our method has a low marginal cost in shifting the embedding vectors across different orders, ii) given a certain order, our method can get the global optimal solutions, and iii) the overall time complexity of our method is linear with respect to network size.

Given an evolutionary network, it is crucial to detect structural anomalies, such as vertices and edges whose \"behaviors'' deviate from underlying majority of the network, in a real-time fashion. Recently, network embedding has proven a powerful tool in learning the low-dimensional representations of vertices in networks that can capture and preserve the network structure. However, most existing network embedding approaches are designed for static networks, and thus may not be perfectly suited for a dynamic environment in which the network representation has to be constantly updated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, NetWalk, for anomaly detection in dynamic networks by learning network representations which can be updated dynamically as the network evolves. We first encode the vertices of the dynamic network to vector representations by clique embedding, which jointly minimizes the pairwise distance of vertex representations of each walk derived from the dynamic networks, and the deep autoencoder reconstruction error serving as a global regularization. The vector representations can be computed with constant space requirements using reservoir sampling. On the basis of the learned low-dimensional vertex representations, a clustering-based technique is employed to incrementally and dynamically detect network anomalies. Compared with existing approaches, NetWalk has several advantages: 1) the network embedding can be updated dynamically, 2) streaming network nodes and edges can be encoded efficiently with constant memory space usage, 3). flexible to be applied on different types of networks, and 4) network anomalies can be detected in real-time.

Most of the existing embedding methods embed nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space. In this way, the formation of the edge is deterministic and only determined by the positions of the nodes. However, the formation and evolution of real-world networks are full of uncertainties, which makes these methods not optimal. To address the problem, we propose a novel Deep Variational Network Embedding in Wasserstein Space (DVNE) in this paper. The proposed method learns a Gaussian distribution in the Wasserstein space as the latent representation of each node, which can simultaneously preserve the network structure and model the uncertainty of nodes. Specifically, we use 2-Wasserstein distance as the similarity measure between the distributions, which can well preserve the transitivity in the network with a linear computational cost. Moreover, our method implies the mathematical relevance of mean and variance by the deep variational model, which can well capture the position of the node by the mean vectors and the uncertainties of nodes by the variance. Additionally, our method captures both the local and global network structure by preserving the first-order and second-order proximity in the network.

Nevertheless, the complete temporal formation process of networks characterized by sequential interactive events between nodes has yet seldom been modeled in the existing studies, which calls for further research on the so-called temporal network embedding problem. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce the concept of neighborhood formation sequence to describe the evolution of a node, where temporal excitation effects exist between neighbors in the sequence, and thus we propose a Hawkes process based Temporal Network Embedding (HTNE) method. HTNE well integrates the Hawkes process into network embedding so as to capture the influence of historical neighbors on the current neighbors. In particular, the interactions of low-dimensional vectors are fed into the Hawkes process as base rate and temporal influence, respectively. In addition, attention mechanism is also integrated into HTNE to better determine the influence of historical neighbors on current neighbors of a node. Experiments on three large-scale real-life networks demonstrate that the embeddings learned from the proposed HTNE model achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods in various tasks including node classification, link prediction, and embedding visualization.

The neighborhood structure of a vertex is usually closely related with an underlying hierarchical taxonomy---the vertices are associated with successively broader categories that can be organized hierarchically. The categories of different levels reflects similarity of different granularity. The hierarchy of the taxonomy therefore requires that the learned representations support multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, the hierarchical taxonomy enables the information to flow between vertices via their common categories, and thus provides an effective mechanism for alleviating data scarcity. However, incorporating the hierarchical taxonomy into network embedding poses a great challenge (since the taxonomy is generally unknown), and it is neglected by the existing approaches. In this paper, we propose NetHiex, a NETwork embedding model that captures the latent HIErarchical taXonomy. In our model, a vertex representation consists of multiple components that are associated with categories of different granularity. The representations of both the vertices and the categories are co-regularized. We employ the nested Chinese restaurant process to guide the search of the most plausible hierarchical taxonomy.

Regular equivalence is defined in a recursive way that two regularly equivalent vertexes have network neighbors which are also regularly equivalent. Accordingly, we propose a new approach named Deep Recursive Network Embedding (DRNE) to learn network embeddings with regular equivalence. More specifically, we propose a layer normalized LSTM to represent each node by aggregating the representations of their neighborhoods in a recursive way. We theoretically prove that some popular and typical centrality measures which are consistent with regular equivalence are optimal solutions of our model. This is also demonstrated by empirical results that the learned node representations can well predict the indexes of regular equivalence and related centrality scores. Furthermore, the learned node representations can be directly used for end applications like structural role classification in networks, and the experimental results show that our method can consistently outperform centrality-based methods and other state-of-the-art network embedding methods.hierarchical taxonomy, nested chinese restaurant process, network embedding, network representation learning", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "A", "references": [], "title": "Content to Node: Self-Translation Network Embedding", "journal": "ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining", "keywords": ["feature learning", "network embedding", "sequence to sequence"], "author": ["Jie Liu", "Zhicheng He", "Lai Wei", "Yalou Huang"], "month": 8, "year": 2018, "reference_count": 33, "DOI": "10.1145/3219819.3219988", "citations(google scholar)": 10, "abstract": "This paper concerns the problem of network embedding (NE), whose aim is to learn low-dimensional representations for nodes in networks. Such dense vector representations offer great promises for many network analysis problems. However, existing NE approaches are still faced with challenges posed by the characteristics of complex networks in real-world applications. First, for many real-world networks associated with rich content information, previous NE methods tend to learn separated content and structure representations for each node, which requires a post-processing of combination. The empirical and simple combination strategies often make the final vector suboptimal. Second, the existing NE methods preserve the structure information by considering short and fixed neighborhood scope, such as the first- and/or the second-order proximities. However, it is hard to decide the scope of the neighborhood when facing a complex problem. To this end, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model based NE framework which is referred to as Self-Translation Network Embedding (STNE) model. With the sequences generated by random walks on a network, STNE learns the mapping that translates each sequence itself from the content sequence to the node sequence. On the one hand, the bi-directional LSTM encoder of STNE fuses the content and structure information seamlessly from the raw input. On the other hand, high-order proximity can be flexibly learned with the memories of LSTM to capture long-range structural information. By such self-translation from content to node, the learned hidden representations can be adopted as node embeddings.

To efficiently learn node embeddings from a graph, graph embedding techniques usually preserve the proximity between node pairs sampled from the graph using random walks. In the context of a heterogeneous graph, which contains nodes from different domains, classical random walks are biased towards highly visible domains where nodes are associated with a dominant number of paths. To overcome this bias, existing heterogeneous graph embedding techniques typically rely on meta-paths (i.e., fixed sequences of node types) to guide random walks. However, using these meta-paths either requires prior knowledge from domain experts for optimal meta-path selection, or requires extended computations to combine all meta-paths shorter than a predefined length. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution that does not involve any meta-path. Specifically, we propose JUST, a heterogeneous graph embedding technique using random walks with JUmp and STay strategies to overcome the aforementioned bias in an more efficient manner. JUST can not only gracefully balance between homogeneous and heterogeneous edges, it can also balance the node distribution over different domains (i.e., node types). By conducting a thorough empirical evaluation of our method on three heterogeneous graph datasets, we show the superiority of our proposed technique. In particular, compared to a state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph embedding technique Hin2vec, which tries to optimally combine all meta-paths shorter than a predefined length, our technique yields better results in most experiments, with a dramatically reduced embedding learning time (about 3x speedup).", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "B", "references": [], "title": "HeteroMed: Heterogeneous Information Network for Medical Diagnosis", "journal": "ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management", "keywords": ["electronic health record", "health informatics", "heterogeneous information network", "network embedding"], "author": ["Anahita Hosseini", "Ting Chen", "Wenjun Wu", "Yizhou Sun", "Majid Sarrafzadeh"], "month": 10, "year": 2018, "reference_count": 35, "DOI": "10.1145/3269206.3271805", "citations(google scholar)": 7, "abstract": "With the recent availability of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and great opportunities they offer for advancing medical informatics, there has been growing interest in mining EHR for improving quality of care. Disease diagnosis due to its sensitive nature, huge costs of error, and complexity has become an increasingly important focus of research in past years. Existing studies model EHR by capturing co-occurrence of clinical events to learn their latent embeddings. However, relations among clinical events carry various semantics and contribute differently to disease diagnosis which gives precedence to a more advanced modeling of heterogeneous data types and relations in EHR data than existing solutions. To address these issues, we represent how high-dimensional EHR data and its rich relationships can be suitably translated into HeteroMed, a heterogeneous information network for robust medical diagnosis. Our modeling approach allows for straightforward handling of missing values and heterogeneity of data. HeteroMed exploits metapaths to capture higher level and semantically important relations contributing to disease diagnosis. Furthermore, it employs a joint embedding framework to tailor clinical event representations to the disease diagnosis goal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use Heterogeneous Information Network for modeling clinical data and disease diagnosis. Experimental results of our study show superior performance of HeteroMed compared to prior methods in prediction of exact diagnosis codes and general disease cohorts. Moreover, HeteroMed outperforms baseline models in capturing similarities of clinical events which are examined qualitatively through case studies.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "B", "references": [], "title": "Abnormal Event Detection via Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding", "journal": "ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management", "keywords": ["abnormal event detection", "heteregeneous information network", "network embedding"], "author": ["Shaohua Fan", "Chuan Shi", "Xiao Wang"], "month": 10, "year": 2018, "reference_count": 7, "DOI": "10.1145/3269206.3269281", "citations(google scholar)": 1, "abstract": "Heteregeneous information networks (HINs) are ubiquitous in the real world, and discovering the abnormal events plays an important role in understanding and analyzing the HIN. The abnormal event usually implies that the number of co-occurrences of entities in a HIN are very rare, so most of the existing works are based on detecting the rare patterns of events. However, we find that the number of co-occurrences of majority entities in events are the same, which brings great challenge to distinguish the normal and abnormal events. Therefore, we argue that considering the heterogeneous information structure only is not sufficient for abnormal event detection and introducing additional valuable information is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel deep heterogeneous network embedding method which incorporates the entity attributes and second-order structures simultaneously to address this problem. Specifically, we utilize type-aware Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) component to learn the attribute embedding, and adopt the autoencoder framework to learn the second-order aware embedding. Then based on the mixed embeddings, we are able to model the pairwise interactions of different entities, such that the events with small entity compatibilities have large abnormal event score.

Most existing methods focus on single network embedding, ignoring the relationship between multiple networks. In many real-world applications, however, multiple networks may contain complementary information, which can lead to further refined node embeddings. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-network embedding method, DMNE. DMNE is flexible. It allows different networks to have different sizes, to be (un)weighted and (un)directed. It leverages multiple networks via cross-network relationships between nodes in different networks, which may form many-to-many node mappings, and be associated with weights. To model the non-linearity of the network data, we develop DMNE to have a new deep learning architecture, which coordinates multiple neural networks (one for each input network data) with a co-regularized loss function. With multiple layers of non-linear mappings, DMNE progressively transforms each input network to a highly non-linear latent space, and in the meantime, adapts different spaces to each other through a co-regularized learning schema. Extensive experimental results on real-life datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "A", "references": [{"ref": "[1] Mohammad Al Hasan, Vineet Chaoji, Saeed Salem, and Mohammed Zaki. 2006.

However, most existing methods fail to consider semantic meanings of links. Different links may have different semantic meanings because the similarities between two nodes can be different, e.g., two nodes share common neighbors and two nodes share similar interests which are demonstrated in node-generated content. In this paper, the former type of links are referred to as structure-close links while the latter type are referred to as content-close links. These two types of links naturally indicate there are two types of characteristics that nodes expose in a social network. Hence, we propose to learn two representations for each node, and render each representation responsible for encoding the corresponding type of node characteristics, which is achieved by jointly embedding the network structure and inferring the type of each link.

The main assumption of existing algorithms is that the learned latent representation for nodes should preserve the structure of the network, in terms of first-order or higher-order connectivity. In other words, nodes that are more similar will have higher probability to connect to each other. This phenomena is typically explained as homophily in network science. However, there is another factor usually neglected by the existing embedding algorithms, which is the popularity of a node. For example, celebrities in a social network usually receive numerous followers, which cannot be fully explained by the similarity of the two users. We denote this factor with the terminology \"social rank\u00bb\u00bb. We then propose a network embedding model that considers both of the two factors in link generation, and learn proximity-based embedding and social rank-based embedding separately. Rather than simply treating these two factors independent with each other, a carefully designed link generation model is proposed, which explicitly models the interdependency between these two types of embeddings. Experiments on several real-world datasets across different domains demonstrate the superiority of our novel network embedding model over the state-of-the-art methods.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "B", "references": [{"ref": "[1] Ahmed, A., Shervashidze, N., Narayanamurthy, S., Josifovski, V., Smola, A.J.: Distributed large-scale natural graph factorization.

Compared with homogeneous networks, heterogeneous information networks (HINs) contain semantic information from multi-typed entities and relations, and are shown to be a more effective model for real world data. The existing network embedding methods fail to explicitly capture the semantics in HINs. In this paper, we propose an HIN embedding model (HINE), which consists of local and global semantic embedding. Local semantic embedding aims to incorporate entity type information via embedding the local structures and types of the entities in a supervised way. Global semantic embedding leverages multi-hop relation types among entities to propagate the global semantics via a Markov Random Field (MRF) to impact the embedding vectors. By doing so, HINE is capable to capture both local and global semantic information in the embedding vectors. Experimental results show that HINE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "A", "references": [{"ref": "[1] M. Belkin and P. Niyogi.

Almost all the existing network embedding methods adopt shallow models. However, since the underlying network structure is complex, shallow models cannot capture the highly non-linear network structure, resulting in sub-optimal network representations. Therefore, how to find a method that is able to effectively capture the highly non-linear network structure and preserve the global and local structure is an open yet important problem. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a Structural Deep Network Embedding method, namely SDNE. More specifically, we first propose a semi-supervised deep model, which has multiple layers of non-linear functions, thereby being able to capture the highly non-linear network structure. Then we propose to exploit the first-order and second-order proximity jointly to preserve the network structure. The second-order proximity is used by the unsupervised component to capture the global network structure. While the first-order proximity is used as the supervised information in the supervised component to preserve the local network structure. By jointly optimizing them in the semi-supervised deep model, our method can preserve both the local and global network structure and is robust to sparse networks. Empirically, we conduct the experiments on five real-world networks, including a language network, a citation network and three social networks. The results show that compared to the baselines, our method can reconstruct the original network significantly better and achieves substantial gains in three applications, i.e. multi-label classification, link prediction and visualization.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "B", "references": [{"ref": "[1] Belkin M, Niyogi P.

In order to capture the semantic subtlety, we propose the concept of aspects with each aspect being a unit representing one underlying semantic facet. Meanwhile, network embedding has emerged as a powerful method for learning network representation, where the learned embedding can be used as features in various downstream applications. Therefore, we are motivated to propose a novel embedding learning framework\u2014AspEm\u2014to preserve the semantic information in HINs based on multiple aspects. Instead of preserving information of the network in one semantic space, AspEm encapsulates information regarding each aspect individually. In order to select aspects for embedding purpose, we further devise a solution for AspEm based on dataset-wide statistics. To corroborate the efficacy of AspEm, we conducted experiments on two real-words datasets with two types of applications\u2014classification and link prediction.

Different from existing approaches that rely heavily on feature engineering, we propose to use network embedding approach to address the problem, which can automatically represent nodes into lower dimensional feature vectors. However, there are two major limitations in recent studies on network embedding: (1) they are usually general-purpose embedding methods, which are independent of the specific tasks; and (2) most of these approaches can only deal with homogeneous networks, where the heterogeneity of the network is ignored. Hence, challenges faced here are two folds: (1) how to embed the network under the guidance of the author identification task, and (2) how to select the best type of information due to the heterogeneity of the network. To address the challenges, we propose a task-guided and path-augmented heterogeneous network embedding model. In our model, nodes are first embedded as vectors in latent feature space. Embeddings are then shared and jointly trained according to task-specific and network-general objectives. We extend the existing unsupervised network embedding to incorporate meta paths in heterogeneous networks, and select paths according to the specific task. The guidance from author identification task for network embedding is provided both explicitly in joint training and implicitly during meta path selection. Our experiments demonstrate that by using path-augmented network embedding with task guidance, our model can obtain significantly better accuracy at identifying the true authors comparing to existing methods.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "B", "references": [{"ref": "[1] A.

Various network embedding methods have been proposed, but they are only designed for a single network scenario. In the era of big data, different types of related information can be fused together to form a coupled heterogeneous network, which consists of two different but related sub-networks connected by inter-network edges. In this scenario, the inter-network edges can act as comple- mentary information in the presence of intra-network ones. This complementary information is important because it can make latent features more comprehensive and accurate. And it is more important when the intra-network edges are ab- sent, which can be referred to as the cold-start problem. In this paper, we thus propose a method named embedding of embedding (EOE) for coupled heterogeneous networks. In the EOE, latent features encode not only intra-network edges, but also inter-network ones. To tackle the challenge of heterogeneities of two networks, the EOE incorporates a harmonious embedding matrix to further embed the em- beddings that only encode intra-network edges. Empirical experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the EOE outperforms consistently single network embedding methods in applications including visualization, link prediction multi-class classification, and multi-label classification.", "important": true}, {"ccfClass": "A", "references": [{"ref": "[1] Ali Amin Ahsan, Hossain Syed Monowar, Hovsepian Karen, Rahman Md Mahbubur, Plarre Kurt, Kumar Santosh. mPuff: Automated Detection of Cigarette Smoking Puffs from Respiration Measurements.

Different nodes have access to different features, as well as access to potentially different computation and energy resources. We concentrate on the problem of jointly learning the parameters for all of the classifiers in the cascade given a fixed cascade architecture and a known set of costs required to carry out the computation at each node. To accomplish the objective of joint learning of all detectors, we propose a novel approach to combining classifier outputs during training that better matches the hard cascade setting in which the learned system will be deployed. This work is motivated by research in the area of mobile health where energy efficient real time detectors integrating information from multiple wireless on-body sensors and a smart phone are needed for real-time monitoring and the delivery of just-in-time adaptive interventions.

However, in reality, it is easier for us to observe the time stamps when different nodes in the network react on a message, while the connections empowering the diffusion of the message remain hidden. This motivates recent extensive studies on the network inference problem : unveiling the edges from the records of messages disseminated through them. Existing solutions are computationally expensive, which motivates us to develop an efficient two-step general framework, Clustering Embedded Network Inference (CENI). CENI integrates clustering strategies to improve the efficiency of network inference. By clustering nodes directly on the time lines of messages, we propose two naive implementations of CENI: Infection-centric CENI and Cascade-centric CENI . Additionally, we point out the critical dimension problem of CENI: Instead of one-dimensional time lines, we need to first project the nodes to an Euclidean space of certain dimension before clustering. A CENI adopting clustering method on the projected space can better preserve the structure hidden in the cascades and generate more accurately inferred links. By addressing the critical dimension problem, we propose the third implementation of the CENI framework: Projection-based CENI . Through extensive experiments on two real datasets, we show that the three CENI models only need around 20\u201350 % of the running time of state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the inferred edges of Projection-based CENI preserve or even outperform the effectiveness of state-of-the-art methods.", "important": true}, {"author": ["Sandro Cavallari", "Vincent W.

We find that community embedding is not only useful for community-level applications such as graph visualization, but also beneficial to both community detection and node classification. To learn such embedding, our insight hinges upon a closed loop among community embedding, community de- tection and node embedding. On the one hand, node embedding can help improve community detection, which outputs good com- munities for fitting better community embedding. On the other hand, community embedding can be used to optimize the node em- bedding by introducing a community-aware high-order proximity. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel community embedding framework that jointly solves the three tasks together.

Although many community detection (CD) algorithms have been proposed, most of them were designed primarily for networks containing only positive links. Thus, it is important to design CD algorithms which can handle large-scale SNs. To this purpose, we first extend the original similarity to the signed similarity based on the social balance theory. Then, based on the signed similarity and the natural contradiction between positive and negative links, two objective functions are designed to model the problem of detecting communities in SNs as a multiobjective problem. Afterward, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called MEAsSN. In MEAs-SN, to overcome the defects of direct and indirect representations for communities, a direct and indirect combined representation is designed. Attributing to this representation, MEAs-SN can switch between different representations during the evolutionary process. As a result, MEAs-SN can benefit from both representations. Moreover, owing to this representation, MEAs-SN can also detect overlapping communities directly. In the experiments, both benchmark problems and large-scale synthetic networks generated by various parameter settings are used to validate the performance of MEAs-SN. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficacy of MEAs-SN on networks with 1000, 5000, and 10000 nodes and also in various noisy situations. A thorough comparison is also made between MEAs-SN and three existing algorithms, and the results show that MEAs-SN outperforms other algorithms.", "keywords": ["Community detection problems", "direct repre- sentation", "indirect representation", "multiobjective evolutionary algorithms", "signed social networks", "similarity."], "reference_count": 65, "references": [{"ref": "[1] S.

Tens of hundreds of methods with significant efforts devoted to community detection in networks, while an open problem in all methods is the unknown number of communities in real networks. It is believed that the central node in a community might be highly surrounded by its neighbors and any two centers of the community reside far from each other, and also believed the similarity among nodes in the same community is larger than the others. Therefore, the local and the global structures\u2019 information shed important light on community detection. In this work, we present a three-stage algorithm to detect communities based on the local and the global information without giving the number of communities beforehand. The three stages include the central nodes identification, the label propagation and the communities combination. The central nodes are identified according to the distance between them larger than the average; the label propagation is to label nodes with the same colors when they reach to the maximum similarity; the communities combination is to merge two communities into one if the increment of the modularity is positive and maximum when the two communities were combined. Experiments and simulation results both on real world and synthetic networks show that the three-stage algorithm possesses well matched properties compared with seven other widely used algorithms, which indicates that three-stage algorithm can be used to detect community in social networks.", "keywords": ["Community detection", "Three-stage algorithm", "Central nodes identification", "Label propagation", "Communities combination"], "reference_count": 33, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Girvan M., Newman M.E.

Compared to user connections, user interactions have been shown to be more meaningful for reflecting peer relationship in OSNs. To this end, we propose a user interaction-oriented community detection method based on cascading analysis. Specifically, user interactions are analyzed from a large collection of social object sharings (e.g., blog posts, photo shares). Both direct and indirect user interactions associated with each social object sharing are then extracted and the cascading relations among these interactions are captured using a graph representation. The proposed method makes use of such cascading relations to extract groups of actively interacting users and adopts a super graph approach to cluster these user groups for detecting communities. An extensive evaluation of our method was performed using three real OSN datasets and compared with three state-of-the-art overlapping community detection methods, namely two general methods applied to the interaction graph and an interaction-based method. Our method outperformed the compared methods, as demonstrated by several evaluation metrics, and produced more robust and stable detection results across different datasets.", "keywords": ["Community detection", "Online social networks", "Overlapping communities", "Cascading analysis"], "reference_count": 45, "references": [{"ref": "[1] MinHash LSH implementation, (https://ekzhu.github.io/datasketch/)."}, {"ref": "[2] Y.-Y.

Motivated by this, a new problem called community focusing (CF) is studied. It fnds a community wherethe members are close and densely connected to the querynodes. A distance-sensitive dense subgraph structure called\u03b2-attention-core is proposed to remove the vertices looselyconnected to or far from the query nodes, and a combinationaldensity is designed to guarantee the density of a subgraph.Then CF is formalized as fnding a subgraph with the largest combinational density among the \u03b2-attention-core subgraphs containing the query nodes with the largest \u03b2. Thereafter, effective methods are devised for CF. Furthermore, a speed-up strategy is developed to make the methods scalable to large networks.

The attributed graph represents the information about properties of the nodes and relationships between different nodes, hence, this attribute information can be used for more accurate community detection. Current techniques of community detection do not consider the attribute or keyword information associated with the nodes in a graph. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm of online community detection using a technique of keyword search over the attributed graph. First, the influential attributes are derived based on the probability of occurrence of each attribute type- value pair on all nodes and edges, respectively. Then, a compact Keyword Attribute Sig- nature is created for each node based on the unique id of each influential attribute. The attributes on each node are classified into different classes, and this class information is assigned on each node to derive the strongest association among different nodes. Once the class information is assigned to all the nodes, we use a keyword search technique to derive a community of nodes belonging to the same class. The keyword search technique makes it possible to search community of nodes in an online and computationally efficient manner compared to the existing techniques. The experi- mental analysis shows that the proposed method derive the community of nodes in an online manner. The nodes in a community are strongly connected to each other and share common attributes. Thus, the community detection can be advanced by using keyword search method, which allows personalized and generalized communities to be retrieved in an online manner.", "keywords": ["Keyword search", "Attributed graphs", "Attribute index", "Personalized community detection", "Generalized community detection"], "reference_count": 41, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Albert R, Barab\u00e1si AL.

Communities, or clusters, are usually groups of vertices having higher probability of being connected to each other than to members of other groups, though other patterns are possible. Identifying communities is an ill-defined problem. There are no universal protocols on the fundamental ingredients, like the definition of community itself, nor on other crucial issues, like the validation of algorithms and the comparison of their performances. This has generated a number of confusions and misconceptions, which undermine the progress in the field. We offer a guided tour through the main aspects of the problem. We also point out strengths and weaknesses of popular methods, and give directions to their use.", "keywords": ["Networks", "Communities", "Clustering"], "reference_count": 202, "references": [{"ref": "[1] G.

In this paper, we identify the problem of dynamictopical community detection and propose a dynamic topical community detection (DTCD) method to detectcommunities and their topical meanings in dynamic networks. The DTCD is a generative model integratingnetwork structure, text, and time. The DTCD considers a community as a mixture of topics and generatesthe neighbors and documents of the node and their time stamps at the same time via the community. Thelatent variables are learned by collapsed Gibbs sampling. The DTCD not only can find communities andtheir topics, but also capture the temporal variations of communities and topics.

This problem has a long history, but it is undergoing a resurgence of interest due to the need to analyze social and biological networks. While there are many ways to formalize it, one of the most popular is as an inference problem, where there is a \u201cground truth\u201d community structure built into the graph somehow. The task is then to recover the ground truth knowing only the graph. Recently it was discovered, first heuristically in physics and then rigorously in probability and computer science, that this problem has a phase transition at which it suddenly becomes impossible. Namely, if the graph is too sparse, or the probabilistic process that generates it is too noisy, then no algorithm can find a partition that is correlated with the planted one\u2014or even tell if there are communities, i.e., dis- tinguish the graph from a purely random one with high probability. Above this information-theoretic threshold, there is a second thresh- old beyond which polynomial-time algorithms are known to succeed; in between, there is a regime in which community detection is possible, but conjectured to require exponential time. For computer scientists, this field offers a wealth of new ideas and open questions, with connections to probability and combinatorics, message-passing algorithms, and random matrix theory. Perhaps more importantly, it provides a window into the cultures of statistical physics and statistical inference, and how those cultures think about distribu- tions of instances, landscapes of solutions, and hardness.", "keywords": ["community structure", "modularity maximization", "spatial null models", "disease dynamics", "radiation model", "gravity model", "synthetic benchmarks", "time-dependent correlation networks"], "reference_count": 81, "references": [{"ref": "[1] E.

Many community detection algorithms have been proposed from different viewpoints. However, uncovering the intrinsic communities in networks is still a non-trivial task due to the difficulty of parameter tuning, user-bias criteria and the lack of ground-truth information. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic model that aims to uncover the communities in networks in a more intuitive and topologically driven way. The basic idea is to explore the community structure by simulating the information exchange in a given network. The information that is flowing on a given network is governed by the underlying network community structure. The community structure, in turn, is reflected by the information dynamics. To prove the convergence of the information dynamic model, the monotone convergence theorem is employed. In the experiments, we have demonstrated that our proposed approach is superior to many representative algorithms on both synthetic and real-world networks.", "keywords": ["Community detection", "Information dynamics", "Propagation", "Cluster"], "reference_count": 38, "references": [{"ref": "[1] S.

It determines where important functions of a network are located. Recently, discovering community structure in complex networks has become a hot topic of research. However, the continuous increase in network size has made network structure more complex, and community detection has become extremely difficult in real applications. In particular, the detection results are usually not accurate enough when classical clustering methods are applied to high-dimensional data matrices. In this paper, inspired by the relationship between vertices, we design a novel and effective network adjacency matrix transformation method to describe vertices\u2019 similarity in the network topology. On this basis, we propose a framework to extract nonlinear features: community detection with deep transitive autoencoder (CDDTA). This framework can obtain powerful nonlinear features of a real network to make community detection algorithms perform excellently in practice. We further incorporate unsupervised transfer learning into the CDDTA (Transfer-CDDTA) by minimizing the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence of embedded instances, to discover powerful low-dimensional representations. Finally, we propose a new training strategy and optimization method for our algorithm. Extensive experimental results indicate that our new framework can ensure good performance on both real-world networks and artificial benchmark networks, which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods for community detection in social networks.", "keywords": ["Community detection", "Complex networks", "Deep autoencoder", "Unsupervised transfer learning"], "reference_count": 33, "references": [{"ref": "[1] L.A.

Extensive experiments on real-world networks are carried out and the obtained results demonstrate that HICODE outperforms several state-of-the-art community detection methods in terms of uncovering both the dominant and the hidden structure.

However, most existing research focus on cases where relationships are explicit or depend on simultaneous appearance. In this paper, we propose to study the community detection problem where the relationships are not based on simultaneous appearance, but time-delayed appearances. In other words, we aim to capture the relationship where one individual physically follows another individual. In our attempt to capture such relationships, the major challenge is the presence of spatial homophily, i.e., individuals are attracted to locations due to their popularities and not because of communications. In tackling the community detection problem with spatial homophily and delayed responses, we make the following key contributions: (1) We introduce a four-phase framework, which by way of using quantified impacts excludes homophily. (2) To validate the framework, we generate a synthetic dataset based on a knoncommunity structure and then infer that community structure. (3) Finally, we execute this framework on a real-world dataset with more than 6,000 taxis in Singapore. Our results are also compared to those of a baseline approach without homophily-elimination.", "keywords": ["Spatial homophily; Community detection; Trajectory simulation;Hotspot detection"], "reference_count": 6, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Vincent D Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte, and Etienne Lefebvre. 2008.

The challenge is to extract useful information buried in the structure of myriad nodes and links. Therefore, powerful tools for simplifying and highlighting important structures in networks are essential for comprehending their organization. Such tools are called community-detection methods and they are designed to identify strongly intraconnected modules that often correspond to important functional units. Here we describe one such method, known as the map equation, and its accompanying algorithms for finding, evaluating, and visualizing the modular organization of networks. The map equation framework is very flexible and can identify two-level, multi-level, and overlapping organization in weighted, directed, and multiplex networks with its search algorithm Infomap. Because the map equation framework operates on the flow induced by the links of a network, it naturally captures flow of ideas and citation flow, and is therefore well-suited for analysis of bibliometric networks.", "keywords": ["Random Walker", "Community Detection", "Module Assignment", "Huffman Code", "Network Partition"], "reference_count": 35, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Aldecoa, R., & Mar\u00edn, I.

Classical clustering approach, -means, has been shown to be very efficient to detect communities in networks. However, -means is quite sensitive to the initial centroids or seeds, especially when it is used to detect communities. To solve this problem, in this study, we propose an efficient algorithm -rank, which selects the top- nodes with the highest rank centrality as the initial seeds, and updates these seeds by using an iterative technique like -means. Then we extend -rank to partition directed, weighted networks, and to detect overlapping communities. The empirical study on synthetic and real networks show that -rank is robust and better than the state-of-the-art algorithms including -means, BGLL, LPA, infomap and OSLOM.", "keywords": ["Community detection", "Clustering", "Rank centrality", "Vertex similarity", "Overlapping communities"], "reference_count": 36, "references": [{"ref": "[1] D.J.

Most community detection algorithms use the links between the nodes in order to determine the dense regions in the graph. These dense regions are the communities of social media in the graph. Such methods are typically based purely on the linkage structure of the underlying social media network. However, in many recent applications, edge content is available in order to provide better supervision to the community detection process. Many natural representations of edges in social interactions such as shared images and videos, user tags and comments are naturally associated with content on the edges. While some work has been done on utilizing node content for community detection, the presence of edge content presents unprecedented opportunities and flexibility for the community detection process. We will show that such edge content can be leveraged in order to greatly improve the effectiveness of the community detection process in social media networks. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "keywords": ["Communities", "Image edge detection", "Vectors", "Social network services", "Media", "Clustering algorithms", "Couplings"], "reference_count": 28, "references": [{"ref": "[1] J.

Most existing community detection algorithms are graph theoretic and lack theability to detect accurate community boundaries if the ratio of intra-community to inter-community links is low. Also, algorithms basedon modularity maximization may fail to resolve communities smaller than a specific size if the community size varies significantly. In thispaper we present a fundamentally different community detection algorithm based on the fact that each network community spans adifferent subspace in the geodesic space. Therefore, each node can only be efficiently represented as a linear combination of nodesspanning the same subspace. To make the process of community detection more robust, we use sparse linear coding with`1normconstraint. In order to find a community label for each node, sparse spectral clustering algorithm is used. The proposed communitydetection technique is compared with more than ten state of the art methods on two benchmark networks (with known clusters) usingnormalized mutual information criterion. Our proposed algorithm outperformed existing algorithms with a significant margin on bothbenchmark networks. The proposed algorithm has also shown excellent performance on three real-world networks.", "keywords": ["\"Complex Networks", "Community Detection", "Sparse Linear Coding", "Sparse Subspace Clustering", "Subspace CommunityDetection\""], "reference_count": 53, "references": [{"ref": "[1] L.

The nodes with similar properties or behaviors are more likely to be in the same community, and vice versa. However, due to the complexity and diversity of networks, the accurate organization or function of communities in many real networks is often extremely difficult to be recognized. Hence, methods for community detection would have immediate impact on understanding the organizations and functions of networks. Therefore, algorithm design becomes a fundamental problem for many networks. In this paper, the local and global information are applied together to propose a divide and agglomerate (DA) algorithm for community detection in social networks. The DA algorithm achieves the result with a two-stage strategy: Dividing a network into small groups according to node pairs\u2019 similarities, and merging a group with the other who has the biggest attraction for it until the community criterion is steady. The novel similarity, constrained AA index captures the local and global information ensuring the optimal communities detection. The results of experiments show that DA algorithm obtains superior community results compared with six other widely used algorithms, which indicate that DA algorithm has advantages for community detection.", "keywords": ["Community detection", "DA algorithm", "Constrained AA index", "Attraction index"], "reference_count": 43, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Y.

Detecting community structure in networks is crucial for insight into the internal connections within networks. A variety of algorithms have previously been proposed, while few of them can efficiently apply to large-scale networks due to unacceptable running time and intractable parameter tuning. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes an adaptive granulation algorithm for community detection based on improved label propagation (Gr-ILP), which granulates a network hierarchically with the improved label propagation strategy. For a given network, first, an improved label propagation strategy (ILP) is adopted to gather similar nodes into non-overlapping collections which consist of nodes with high similarity. Second, each collection detected in first step is granulated into a super node, and the edges between two collections are granulated into a super edge. After this granulation processing, a super-network that is coarser and smaller than the original one is formed. Then, the above two steps are repeated iteratively until it stops forming new collections in the first step. Due to the adoption of an adaptive strategy, the proposed Gr-ILP algorithm granulates the network to a certain layer which saves much time when processing large-scale networks. Finally, Gr-ILP assigns unallocated and isolated nodes to the appropriate community. The proposed algorithm requires neither any priori information of communities nor adjustment of any parameters and still can obtained satisfactory community structure adaptively. Gr-ILP tends to preserve small-scale communities by limiting the growth of node collections. Moreover, because of the sharp decline in network size by the granulation process, the algorithm consumes less time and is suitable for large-scale networks. Experimental results on eight real-world network datasets of different types and sizes demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm, compared with several other baseline algorithms.", "keywords": ["Complex network", "Community detection", "Granulation", "Improved label propagation", "Adaptivity"], "reference_count": 56, "references": [{"ref": "[1] M.

However, mostexisting research focus on cases where relationships are explicit ordepend on simultaneous appearance. In this paper, we propose tostudy the community detection problem where the relationshipsare not based on simultaneous appearance, but time-delayed ap-pearances. In other words, we aim to capture the relationship whereone individual physically follows another individual. In our attemptto capture such relationships, the major challenge is the presenceof spatial homophily, i.e., individuals are attracted to locations dueto their popularities and not because of communications.In tackling the community detection problem with spatial ho-mophily and delayed responses, we make the following key contri-butions: (1) We introduce a four-phase framework, which by wayof using quantified impacts excludes homophily. (2) To validatethe framework, we generate a synthetic dataset based on a knowncommunity structure and then infer that community structure. (3)Finally, we execute this framework on a real-world dataset withmore than 6,000 taxis in Singapore.

When detecting communities, there are two possible sources of information one can use: the network structure, and the features and attributes of nodes. Even though communities form around nodes that have common edges and common attributes, typically, algorithms have only focused on one of these two data modalities: community detection algorithms traditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms mostly consider only node attributes. In this paper, we develop Com- munities from Edge Structure and Node Attributes (CESNA), an accurate and scalable algorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node attributes. CESNA statis- tically models the interaction between the network structure and the node attributes, which leads to more accurate community detection as well as improved robustness in the presence of noise in the network structure. CESNA has a linear runtime in the network size and is able to process networks an order of magnitude larger than comparable approaches. Last, CESNA also helps with the interpretation of detected communities by finding relevant node attributes for each community.", "keywords": ["Overlapping community detection", "Network communities", "Community detection", "Node attributes"], "reference_count": 43, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Y.-Y.

In recent years, many community detection algorithms have been proposed to unveil the structural properties and dynamic behaviors of networks. In this study, we attempt a contemporary survey on the methods of community detection and its applications in the various domains of real life. Besides highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each community detection approach, different aspects of algorithmic performance comparison and their testing on standard benchmarks are discussed. The challenges faced by community detection algorithms, open issues and future trends related to community detection are also postulated. The main goal of this paper is to put forth a review of prevailing community detection algorithms that range from traditional algorithms to state of the art algorithms for overlapping community detection. Algorithms based on dimensionality reduction techniques such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and principal component analysis (PCA) are also focused.

Many algorithms have been proposed but the crucial issue of testing, i.e., the question of how good an algorithm is, with respect to others, is still open. Standard tests include the analysis of simple artificial graphs with a built-in community structure, that the algorithm has to recover. However, the special graphs adopted in actual tests have a structure that does not reflect the real properties of nodes and commu- nities found in real networks. Here we introduce a class of benchmark graphs, that account for the heteroge- neity in the distributions of node degrees and of community sizes. We use this benchmark to test two popular methods of community detection, modularity optimization, and Potts model clustering. The results show that the benchmark poses a much more severe test to algorithms than standard benchmarks, revealing limits that may not be apparent at a first analysis.", "keywords": ["Cluster Analysis Models", "Statistical Algorithms Neural Networks (Computer Models", "Theoretical Models", "Biological Community Networks"], "reference_count": 25, "references": [{"ref": "\udbff\udc02[1]\udbff\udc03 M.

These networks are known to be highly modular, with groups of proteins associated with specific biological functions. Human diseases often arise from the dysfunction of one or more such proteins of the biological functional group. The ability, to identify and automatically extract these modules has implications for understanding the etiology of different diseases as well as the functional roles of different protein modules in disease. The recent DREAM challenge posed the problem of identifying disease modules from six heterogeneous networks of proteins/genes. There exist many community detection algorithms, but all of them are not adaptable to the biological context, as these networks are densely connected and the size of biologically relevant modules is quite small. The contribution of this study is 3-fold: first, we present a comprehensive assessment of many classic community detection algorithms for biological networks to identify non-overlapping communities, and propose heuristics to identify small and structurally well-defined communities\u2014core modules. We evaluated our performance over 180 GWAS datasets. In comparison to traditional approaches, with our proposed approach we could identify 50% more number of disease-relevant modules. Thus, we show that it is important to identify more compact modules for better performance. Next, we sought to understand the peculiar characteristics of disease-enriched modules and what causes standard community detection algorithms to detect so few of them. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the interaction patterns of known disease genes to understand the structure of disease modules and show that merely considering the known disease genes set as a module does not give good quality clusters, as measured by typical metrics such as modularity and conductance. We go on to present a methodology leveraging these known disease genes, to also include the neighboring nodes of these genes into a module, to form good quality clusters and subsequently extract a \u201cgold-standard set\u201d of disease modules. Lastly, we demonstrate, with justification, that \u201coverlapping\u201d community detection algorithms should be the preferred choice for disease module identification since several genes participate in multiple biological functions.", "keywords": ["overlapping community detection", "non-overlapping community detection", "disease module identification", "biological networks", "heterogeneous networks"], "reference_count": 39, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Andersen, R., Chung, F., and Lang, K.

However, research on detecting community structure (community detection) still has some unsolved problems. In this paper, we introduce a new community detection algorithm, called Commansor (Community Detection Based on Human Social Behavior), which automatically detects communities in the network by simulating human social behavior. The fundamental principle of Commansor is finding the social comfort zone of human beings in the social process and simulating the evolution of social network structure in the information spreading process. Different closeness relationships between nodes form a comfort zone for each node, and the process of information spreading has an important impact on the evolution of the community structure. The main steps of the Commansor algorithm include (a) finding a comfort zone for each node by using closeness matrices, (b) randomly selecting an associated node from the comfort zone for each node to reconstruct a simplified network, and (c) adjusting the simplified network structure by simulating the process of information spreading in human society. We compared Commansor with a range of typical algorithms by performing extensive experiments on synthetic networks and real-world networks. The experiments proved that, in most cases, our algorithm is superior to the compared algorithms in terms of the quality of community detection.", "keywords": ["Complex network", "Community detection", "Human social behavior", "Adjacency matrix", "Comfort zone", "Simplified network"], "reference_count": 48, "references": [{"ref": "[1] H.-J.

A community (also referred to as a cluster) is a set of cohesive vertices that have more connections inside the set than outside. In many social and information networks, these communities naturally overlap. For instance, in a social network, each vertex in a graph corresponds to an individual who usually participates in multiple communities. In this paper, we propose an efficient overlapping community detection algorithm using a seed expansion approach. The key idea of our algorithm is to find good seeds, and then greedily expand these seeds based on a community metric. Within this seed expansion method, we investigate the problem of how to determine good seed nodes in a graph. In particular, we develop new seeding strategies for a personalized PageRank clustering scheme that optimizes the conductance community score. An important step in our method is the neighborhood inflation step where seeds are modified to represent their entire vertex neighborhood. Experimental results show that our seed expansion algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art overlapping community detection methods in terms of producing cohesive clusters and identifying ground-truth communities. We also show that our new seeding strategies are better than existing strategies, and are thus effective in finding good overlapping communities in real-world networks.", "keywords": ["Clustering algorithms", "Kernel", "Image edge detection", "Collaboration", "MySpace"], "reference_count": 33, "references": [{"ref": "[1] J.

These can be described as a multilayer network where each layer represents one type of interaction. These layers may be interdependent in complicated ways, revealing different kinds of structure in the network. In this work we present a generative model, and an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm, which allows us to perform inference tasks such as community detection and link prediction in this setting. Our model assumes overlapping communities that are common between the layers, while allowing these communities to affect each layer in a different way, including arbitrary mixtures of assortative, disassortative, or directed structure. It also gives us a mathematically principled way to define the interdependence between layers, by measuring how much information about one layer helps us predict links in another layer. In particular, this allows us to bundle layers together to compress redundant information and identify small groups of layers which suffice to predict the remaining layers accurately. We illustrate these findings by analyzing synthetic data and two real multilayer networks, one representing social support relationships among villagers in South India and the other representing shared genetic substring material between genes of the malaria parasite.", "keywords": [""], "reference_count": 47, "references": [{"ref": "[1] M.

The knowledge of this feature is of great advantage: it not only provides helpful insights into developing more efficient social-aware solutions but also promises a wide range of applications enabled by social and mobile networking, such as routing strategies in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and worm containment in OSNs. Unfortunately, understanding this structure is very challenging, especially in dynamic social networks where social interactions are evolving rapidly. Our work focuses on the following questions: How can we efficiently identify communities in dynamic social networks? How can we adaptively update the network community structure based on its history instead of recomputing from scratch? To this end, we present Quick Community Adaptation (QCA), an adaptive modularity-based framework for not only discovering but also tracing the evolution of network communities in dynamic OSNs. QCA is very fast and efficient in the sense that it adaptively updates and discovers the new community structure based on its history together with the network changes only. This flexible approach makes QCA an ideal framework applicable for analyzing large-scale dynamic social networks due to its lightweight computing-resource requirement. To illustrate the effectiveness of our framework, we extensively test QCA on both synthesized and real-world social networks including Enron, arXiv e-print citation, and Facebook networks. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of QCA in real applications: (1) A social-aware message forwarding strategy in MANETs, and (2) worm propagation containment in OSNs. Competitive results in comparison with other methods reveal that social-based techniques employing QCA as a community detection core outperform current available methods.", "keywords": ["self-assembled monolayers", "dispersion-corrected density functional theory", "work function", "interface electronic structure"], "reference_count": 39, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Girvan M, Newman MEJ (2002) Community structure in social and biological networks.

Many algorithms have beenproposed, most of which only use linkage structure. However, rich information is encoded in the content of social networks such asnode content and edge content, which is essential to discover topically meaningful communities. Therefore, to detect both structurallyand topically meaningful communities, linkage structure, node content and edge content should be integrated. The main challenge liesin how to integrate them dynamically in a seamless way. This paper proposes a novel transformation of content-based network into aNode-Edge Interaction (NEI) network where linkage structure, node content and edge content are embedded seamlessly. A differentialactivity based approach is proposed to incrementally maintain the NEI network as the content-based network evolves. To capture thesemantic effect of different edge types, a transition probability matrix is devised for the NEI network. Based on this, heterogeneousrandom walk is applied to discover dynamic communities, leading to a new dynamic community detection method termed NEIWalk(NEInetwork based random Walk). Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed NEIWalk method gets abounded accuracy lossdueto the random walk sampling. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of NEIWalk", "keywords": ["Dynamic community detection", "social network", "linkage structure", "content information", "heterogeneous random walk"], "reference_count": 55, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection [Online].

In this paper, we constructed a semantic network using the semantic information extracted from comment content. In our modeling, we considered the impact of the weight on every edge and focused on the \u201cgiant component\u201d of the online social network to reduce computational complexity; thus, our method can handle large-scale networks. In the experimental work, we evaluated our method using real datasets and compared our approach with several previous methods based on comment interactions; the results show that our method is much faster, more effective and robust.", "keywords": ["Online social network", "Comment content", "Semantic network", "Community detection", "Giant component"], "reference_count": 29, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Jennifer J.

In the literature, various community models have been proposed. However, most of them cannot well identify the overlaps between communities which is an essential feature of real graphs. To address this issue, the k-clique percolation community model was proposed and has been proven effective in many applications. Motivated by this, in this paper, we adopt the k-clique percolation community model and study the densest clique percolation community search problem which aims to find the k-clique percolation community with the maximum k value that contains a given set of query nodes. We adopt an index-based approach to solve this problem. Based on the observation that a k-clique percolation community is a union of maximal cliques, we devise a novel compact index, DCPC-Index, to preserve the maximal cliques and their connectivity information of the input graph. With DCPC-Index, we can answerthe densest clique percolation community query efficiently. Besides, we also propose an index construction algorithm based on the definition of DCPC-Index and further improve the algorithm in terms of efficiency and memory consumption. We conduct extensive performance studies on real graphs and the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our index-based query processing algorithm and index construction algorithm.", "keywords": ["k-clique percolation community", "community search", "social network"], "reference_count": 40, "references": [{"ref": "[1] D.

Recently, overlapping community detection becomes a trend due to the ubiquity of overlapping and nested communities in real world. However, existing approaches have ignored the use of implicit link preference information, i.e., links can reflect a node\u2019s preference on the targets of connections it wants to build. This information has strong impact on community detection since a node prefers to build links with nodes inside its community than those outside its community. In this paper, we propose a preference-based nonnegative matrix factorization (PNMF) model to incorporate implicit link preference information. Unlike conventional matrix factorization approaches, which simply approximate the original adjacency matrix in value, our model maximizes the likelihood of the preference order for each node by following the intuition that a node prefers its neighbors than other nodes. Our model overcomes the indiscriminate penalty problem in which non-linked pairs inside one community are equally penalized in objective functions as those across two communities. We propose a learning algorithm which can learn a node-community membership matrix via stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We evaluate our PNMF model on several real-world networks.

Most of the previous works in this area cannot learn a good representation from content for recommendation task or consider only text modality of the content, thus their methods are very limited in current multimedia scenario. This paper proposes a Bayesian generative model called collaborative variational autoencoder (CVAE) that considers both rating and content for recommendation in multimedia scenario. The model learns deep latent representations from content data in an unsupervised manner and also learns implicit relationships between items and users from both content and rating.

To address this sparsity problem, auxiliary information such as item content information may be utilized. Collaborative topic regression (CTR) is an appealing recent method taking this approach which tightly couples the two components that learn from two different sources of information. Nevertheless, the latent representation learned by CTR may not be very effective when the auxiliary information is very sparse.

We argue that, for each user of a social platform, her potential embedding is influenced by her trusted users. As social influence recursively propagates and diffuses in the social network, each user's interests change in the recursive process. Nevertheless, the current social recommendation models simply developed static models by leveraging the local neighbors of each user without simulating the recursive diffusion in the global social network, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a deep influence propagation model to stimulate how users are influenced by the recursive social diffusion process for social recommendation. For each user, the diffusion process starts with an initial embedding that fuses the related features and a free user latent vector that captures the latent behavior preference. The key idea of our proposed model is that we design a layer-wise influence propagation structure to model how users' latent embeddings evolve as the social diffusion process continues.

In particular, we find that the resultant model is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on its model parameters, which implies the possibly large error in generalization. To enhance the robustness of a recommender model and thus improve its generalization performance, we propose a new optimization framework, namely Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR). In short, our APR enhances the pairwise ranking method BPR by performing adversarial training. It can be interpreted as playing a minimax game, where the minimization of the BPR objective function meanwhile defends an adversary, which adds adversarial perturbations on model parameters to maximize the BPR objective function. To illustrate how it works, we implement APR on MF by adding adversarial perturbations on the embedding vectors of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of APR - by optimizing MF with APR, it outperforms BPR with a relative improvement of 11.2% on average and achieves state-of-the-art performance for item recommendation.

Nevertheless, one important type of features, the aesthetic features, is seldom considered. It plays a vital role in clothing recommendation since a users\u00bb decision depends largely on whether the clothing is in line with her aesthetics, however the conventional image features cannot portray this directly. To bridge this gap, we propose to introduce the aesthetic information, which is highly relevant with user preference, into clothing recommender systems. To achieve this, we first present the aesthetic features extracted by a pre-trained neural network, which is a brain-inspired deep structure trained for the aesthetic assessment task. Considering that the aesthetic preference varies significantly from user to user and by time, we then propose a new tensor factorization model to incorporate the aesthetic features in a personalized manner.

The nature of multimedia user-item interactions is 1/0 binary implicit feedback (e.g., photo likes, video views, song downloads, etc.), which can be collected at a larger scale with a much lower cost than explicit feedback (e.g., product ratings). However, the majority of existing collaborative filtering (CF) systems are not well-designed for multimedia recommendation, since they ignore the implicitness in users' interactions with multimedia content. We argue that, in multimedia recommendation, there exists item- and component-level implicitness which blurs the underlying users' preferences. The item-level implicitness means that users' preferences on items (e.g. photos, videos, songs, etc.) are unknown, while the component-level implicitness means that inside each item users' preferences on different components (e.g. regions in an image, frames of a video, etc.) are unknown. For example, a 'view'' on a video does not provide any specific information about how the user likes the video (i.e.item-level) and which parts of the video the user is interested in (i.e.component-level). In this paper, we introduce a novel attention mechanism in CF to address the challenging item- and component-level implicit feedback in multimedia recommendation, dubbed Attentive Collaborative Filtering (ACF). Specifically, our attention model is a neural network that consists of two attention modules: the component-level attention module, starting from any content feature extraction network (e.g. CNN for images/videos), which learns to select informative components of multimedia items, and the item-level attention module, which learns to score the item preferences.

As such, the key to an item-based CF method is in the estimation of item similarities. Early approaches use statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Pearson coefficient to estimate item similarities, which are less accurate since they lack tailored optimization for the recommendation task. In recent years, several works attempt to learn item similarities from data, by expressing the similarity as an underlying model and estimating model parameters by optimizing a recommendation-aware objective function. While extensive efforts have been made to use shallow linear models for learning item similarities, there has been relatively less work exploring nonlinear neural network models for item-based CF. In this work, we propose a neural network model named Neural Attentive Item Similarity model (NAIS) for item-based CF.

We show that most existing models, including NTN (Socher et al., 2013) and TransE (Bordes et al., 2013b), can be generalized under a uni\ufb01ed learning framework, where entities are low-dimensional vectors learned from a neural network and relations are bilinear and/or linear mapping functions. Under this framework, we compare a variety of embedding models on the link prediction task. We show that a simple bilinear formulation achieves new state-of-the-art results for the task (achieving a top-10 accuracy of 73.2% vs. 54.7% by TransE on Freebase). Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes the learned relation embeddings to mine logical rules such as BornInCitypa,bq^ CityInCountrypb,cq \u00f9\u00f1 Nationalitypa,cq. We \ufb01nd that embeddings learned from the bilinear objective are particularly good at capturing relational semantics, and that the composition of relations is characterized by matrix multiplication. More interestingly, we demonstrate that our embedding-based rule extraction approach successfully outperforms a state-ofthe-art con\ufb01dence-based rule mining approach in mining Horn rules that involve compositional reasoning.", "keywords": ["keywords"], "reference_count": 35, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1]Auer, S\u00a8oren, Bizer, Christian, Kobilarov, Georgi, Lehmann, Jens, Cyganiak, Richard, and Ives,Zachary.

Most of existing node embedding algorithms and systems are capable of processing networks with hundreds of thousands or a few millions of nodes. However, how to scale them to networks that have tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of nodes remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose GraphVite, a high-performance CPU-GPU hybrid system for training node embeddings, by co-optimizing the algorithm and the system. On the CPU end, augmented edge samples are parallelly generated by random walks in an online fashion on the network, and serve as the training data. On the GPU end, a novel parallel negative sampling is proposed to leverage multiple GPUs to train node embeddings simultaneously, without much data transfer and synchronization. Moreover, an efficient collaboration strategy is proposed to further reduce the synchronization cost between CPUs and GPUs. Experiments on multiple real-world networks show that GraphVite is super efficient. It takes only about one minute for a network with 1 million nodes and 5 million edges on a single machine with 4 GPUs, and takes around 20 hours for a network with 66 million nodes and 1.8 billion edges. Compared to the current fastest system, GraphVite is about 50 times faster without any sacrifice on performance.", "keywords": ["Unsupervised node embedding", "parallel processing", "scalability", "graphics processing unit"], "reference_count": 40, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Mart\u00edn Abadi, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, et al.2016.

Much success has been reported recently by techniques that \ufb01rst compute a similarity structure of the data points and then project them into a low-dimensional space with the structure preserved. These two steps su\ufb00er from considerable computational costs, preventing the state-ofthe-art methods such as the t-SNE from scaling to largescale and high-dimensional data (e.g., millions of data points and hundreds of dimensions). We propose the LargeVis, a technique that \ufb01rst constructs an accurately approximated K-nearest neighbor graph from the data and then layouts the graph in the low-dimensional space. Comparing to tSNE, LargeVis signi\ufb01cantly reduces the computational cost of the graph construction step and employs a principled probabilistic model for the visualization step, the objective of which can be e\ufb00ectively optimized through asynchronous stochastic gradient descent with a linear time complexity. The whole procedure thus easily scales to millions of highdimensional data points. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate that the LargeVis outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both e\ufb03ciency and e\ufb00ectiveness. The hyper-parameters of LargeVis are also much more stable over di\ufb00erent data sets.", "keywords": ["Visualization", "big data", "high-dimensional data"], "reference_count": 28, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] M.

Recent research in the broader \ufb01eld of representation learning has led to signi\ufb01cant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec,an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec,we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We de\ufb01ne a \ufb02exible notion of a node\u2019s network neighborhood and design a biased randomwalk procedure, which ef\ufb01ciently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods,and we argue that the added \ufb02exibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the ef\ufb01cacy of node2vec over existing state-ofthe-art techniques on multi-label classi\ufb01cation and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains.

Tensor factorization approaches have proved promising for such link prediction problems. Proposedin1927,CanonicalPolyadic(CP)decompositionisamongthe\ufb01rsttensor factorization approaches. CP generally performs poorly for link prediction as it learns two independent embedding vectors for each entity, whereas they are really tied. We present a simple enhancement of CP (which we call SimplE) to allow the two embeddings of each entity to be learned dependently. The complexity of SimplE grows linearly with the size of embeddings. The embeddings learned through SimplE are interpretable, and certain types of background knowledge can be incorporated into these embeddings through weight tying. We prove SimplE is fully expressive and derive a bound on the size of its embeddings for full expressivity. We show empirically that, despite its simplicity, SimplE outperforms several state-of-the-art tensor factorization techniques.
