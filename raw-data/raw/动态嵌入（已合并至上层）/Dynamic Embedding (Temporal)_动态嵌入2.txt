Lots of state-of-the-art network embedding methods based on Skip-gram framework are efficient and effective. However, these methods mainly focus on the static network embedding and cannot naturally generalize to the dynamic environment. In this paper, we propose a stable dynamic embed- ding framework with high efficiency. It is an extension for the Skip-gram based network embedding methods, which can keep the optimality of the objective in the Skip-gram based methods in theory. Our model can not only generalize to the new ver- tex representation, but also update the most affected original vertex representations during the evolvement of the network. Multi-class classification on three real-world networks demonstrates that, our model can update the vertex representations efficiently and achieve the performance of retraining simultaneously. Besides, the visualization experimental result illustrates that, our model is capable of avoiding the embedding space drifting.", "keywords": ["Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning", "Machine Learning Applications: Networks"], "reference_count": 25, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Belkin and Niyogi, 2001.

Nevertheless, the complete temporal formation process of networks characterized by sequential interactive events between nodes has yet seldom been modeled in the existing studies, which calls for further research on the so-called temporal network embedding problem. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce the concept of neighborhood formation sequence to describe the evolution of a node, where temporal excitation effects exist between neighbors in the sequence, and thus we propose a Hawkes process based Temporal Network Embedding (HTNE) method. HTNE well integrates the Hawkes process into network embedding so as to capture the influence of historical neighbors on the current neighbors. In particular, the interactions of low-dimensional vectors are fed into the Hawkes process as base rate and temporal influence, respectively. In addition, attention mechanism is also integrated into HTNE to better determine the influence of historical neighbors on current neighbors of a node. Experiments on three large-scale real-life networks demonstrate that the embeddings learned from the proposed HTNE model achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods in various tasks including node classification, link prediction, and embedding visualization. In particular, temporal recommendation based on arrival rate inferred from node embeddings shows excellent predictive power of the proposed model.", "keywords": ["Temporal Network", "Network Embedding", "Learning Representation", "Hawkes Process"], "reference_count": 30, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Amr Ahmed, Nino Shervashidze, Shravan Narayanamurthy, Vanja Josifovski, and Alexander J.

Given an evolutionary network, it is crucial to detect structural anomalies, such as vertices and edges whose \u201cbehaviors\u201d deviate from underlying majority of the network, in a real-time fashion. Recently, network embedding has proven a powerful tool in learning the low-dimensional representations of vertices in networks that can capture and preserve the network structure. However, most existing network embedding approaches are designed for static networks, and thus may not be perfectly suited for a dynamic environment in which the network representation has to be constantly updated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, NetWalk, for anomaly detection in dynamic networks by learning network representations which can be updated dynamically as the network evolves. We first encode the vertices of the dynamic network to vector representations by clique embedding, which jointly minimizes the pairwise distance of vertex representations of each walk derived from the dynamic networks, and the deep autoencoder reconstruction error serving as a global regularization. The vector representations can be computed with constant space requirements using reservoir sampling. On the basis of the learned low-dimensional vertex representations, a clustering-based technique is employed to incrementally and dynamically detect network anomalies. Compared with existing approaches, NetWalk has several advantages: 1) the network embedding can be updated dynamically, 2) streaming network nodes and edges can be encoded efficiently with constant memory space usage, 3). flexible to be applied on different types of networks, and 4) network anomalies can be detected in real- time. Extensive experiments on four real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NetWalk.", "keywords": ["Anomaly detection", "dynamic network embedding", "deep autoencoder", "clique embedding"], "reference_count": 44, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Charu C Aggarwal. 2013.

As the networks evolve over times, the interactions among the nodes in networks make heterogeneous networks exhibit dynamic characteristics. However, almost all the existing heterogeneous network representation learning methods focus on static networks which ignore dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach DHNE to learn the representations of nodes in dynamic heterogeneous networks. The key idea of our approach is to construct comprehensive historical-current networks based on subgraphs of snapshots in time step to capture both the historical and current information in the dynamic heterogeneous network. And then under the guidance of meta paths, DHNE performs random walks on the constructed historical-current graphs to capture semantic information. After getting the node sequences through random walks, we propose the dynamic heterogeneous skip-gram model to learn the embeddings. Experiments on large-scale real-world networks demonstrate that the embeddings learned by the proposed DHNE model achieve better performances than state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks including node classification and visualization.", "keywords": ["Dynamic heterogeneous networks", "network representation learning", "random walk", "skip-gram model"], "reference_count": 29, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] C.

It has been proven extremely useful in many machine learning tasks over large graph. Most existing methods focus on learning the structural representations of vertices in a static network, but cannot guarantee an accurate and efficient embedding in a dynamic network scenario. The fundamental problem of continuously capturing the dynamic properties in an efficient way for a dynamic network remains unsolved. To address this issue, we present an efficient incremental skip-gram algorithm with negative sampling for dynamic network embedding, and provide a set of theoretical analyses to characterize the performance guarantee. Specifically, we first partition a dynamic network into the updated, including addition/deletion of links and vertices, and the retained networks over time. Then we factorize the objective function of network embedding into the added, vanished and retained parts of the network. Next we provide a new stochastic gradient-based method, guided by the partitions of the network, to update the nodes and the parameter vectors. The proposed algorithm is proven to yield an objective function value with a bounded difference to that of the original objective function. The first order moment of the objective difference converges in order of O( 1 ), and the second order moment of the n2 objective difference can be stabilized in order of O(1). Experimental results show that our proposal can significantly reduce the training time while preserving the comparable performance. We also demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the practical usefulness of the dynamic network embedding. We perform extensive experiments on multiple real-world large network datasets over multi-label classification and link prediction tasks to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework, and up to 22 times speedup has been achieved.", "keywords": ["Dynamic Network Embedding", "Bound and Convergence Analysis", "Multi-label Classification", "Link Prediction"], "reference_count": 45, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Shaosheng Cao, Wei Lu, and Qiongkai Xu.

In recent years, the concept of network embedding has attracted lots of attention to deal with various network analytic tasks, the purpose of which is to encode relationships or information of networked elements into a low-dimensional vector space. However, most existing embedding methods have focused mainly on preserving static network information, such as structural proximity, node/edge attributes, and labels. On the contrary, in this paper, we focus on the embedding problem of preserving dynamic characteristics of epidemic spreading on social networks. We propose a novel embedding method, namely EpiRep, to learn node representations of a network by maximizing the likelihood of preserving groups of infected nodes due to the epidemics starting from every single node on the network. Specifically, the Susceptible-Infectious model is adopted to simulate the epidemic dynamics on networks, and the Continuous Bag-of-Words model with negative sampling is used to obtain node representations. Experimental results show that the EpiRep method outperforms two benchmark random-walk based embedding methods in terms of node clustering and classification on several synthetic and real-world networks. The proposed method and findings in this paper may offer new insight for source identification and infection prevention in the face of epidemic spreading on social networks.", "keywords": ["Network embedding", "Susceptible-Infectious model", "Random walks", "Continuous Bag-of-Words", "Epidemic dynamics"], "reference_count": 40, "ccfClass": "", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Amr Ahmed, Nino Shervashidze, Shravan Narayanamurthy, Vanja Josifovski, and Alexander J Smola. 2013.

Among them, a large number of networks are not only topologically structured but also have a rich set of features on nodes. These node features are usually of high dimensionality with noisy, irrelevant and redundant in- formation, which may impede the performance of other learning tasks. Feature selection is useful to alleviate these critical issues. Nonetheless, a vast majority of existing feature selection algorithms are predominantly designed in a static setting. In reality, real-world networks are naturally dynamic, characterized by both topology and content changes. It is desirable to capture these changes to find relevant features tightly hinged with network structure continuously, which is of fundamental importance for many applications such as disaster relief and viral marketing. In this paper, we study a novel problem of time-evolving feature selection for dynamic networks in an unsupervised scenario. Specifically, we propose a TeFS framework by leveraging the temporal evolution property of dynamic networks to update the feature selection results incrementally. Experimental results show the superiority of TeFS over the state-of-the-art batch-mode unsupervised feature selection algorithms.", "keywords": ["unsupervised learning", "feature selection", "dynamic networks"], "reference_count": 23, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Charu Aggarwal and Karthik Subbian.

The problem of efficiently performing dynamic link inference is extremely challenging due to the dynamic nature in massive evolving networks especially when there exist sparse connectivities and nonlinear transitional patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, i.e., Conditional Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ctRBM), which predicts links based on individual transition variance as well as influence introduced by local neighbors. The proposed model is robust to noise and have the exponential capability to capture nonlinear variance. We tackle the computational challenges by developing an efficient algorithm for learning and inference of the proposed model. To improve the efficiency of the approach, we give a faster approximated implementation based on a proposed Neighbor Influence Clustering algorithm. Extensive experiments on simulated as well as real-world dynamic networks show that the proposed method outperforms existing algorithms in link inference on dynamic networks.", "keywords": ["electrocardiography", "electromyography", "feedback", "force sensors", "fuzzy control", "medical signal processing", "position control", "prosthetics", "sensors", "EEG based position control"], "reference_count": 21, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] L.
