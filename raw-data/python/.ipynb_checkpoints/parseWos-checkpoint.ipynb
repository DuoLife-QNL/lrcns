To reveal resemblance patterns of kinship while discarding the similarity patterns that can also be observed between people who do not have a kin relationship, a novel contrastive loss function is defined in the visual appearance space. For further optimization, the learned representation is fine-tuned using a feature-based contrastive loss. An expression matching procedure is employed in the model to minimize the negative influence of expression differences between kin pairs. Each kin video is analyzed by a sliding temporal window to leverage short-term facial dynamics.

Unlike existing models that typically learn from facial expression labels alone, we devise an effective multitask network that is capable of learning from rich auxiliary attributes such as gender, age, and head pose, beyond just facial expression data. While conventional supervised training requires datasets with complete labels (e.g., all samples must be labeled with gender, age, and expression), we show that this requirement can be relaxed via a novel attribute propagation method. The approach further allows us to leverage the inherent correspondences between heterogeneous attribute sources despite the disparate distributions of different datasets. With the network we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on existing facial expression recognition benchmarks.

Corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for \"word of mouth\" advertising based on the relations between the customers. When we collect and observe relationships between people, missing or redundant relations unavoidably occur since the time and cost restrictions in market or social investigation prevent us to discover all the relations. Moreover, since the social relations are changing constantly, current social relations may disappear, and new relations will be established. Many trade and social networks consist of multiple types of relations between the individuals. This paper presents an efficient method to detect the potential and future social relations between individuals in multi-relational social networks using link prediction. First, we calculate the belief of each individual by belief propagation on each type of relations. Based on the belief vectors, the similarities between various types of relations are computed to measure their mutual influence. Based on the similarities between various types of relations, we model link prediction as the problem of matrix completion by optimizing its max-norm constrained formulation. We propose a projected gradient descent optimization algorithm which is scalable to large size networks.

To this end, a procedure for determining the weak ground truth on churn influence is presented and used to determine the churn influence of prepaid customers. The determined scores are used to identify good churn-influence predictors among 74 candidate features. The identified predictors are finally used to build a churn-influence-prediction model. The results show that considerably better churn prediction results can be achieved using the proposed model together with the classical churn-prediction-model than by using the classical churn-prediction model alone.

Understanding users' social influences in social networks can benefit many applications, such as social recommendation and social marketing. In this paper, we focus on the problem of predicting users' social influences on upcoming events in EBSNs. We formulate this prediction problem as the estimation of unobserved entries of the constructed user-event social influence matrix, where each entry represents the influence value of a user on an event. In particular, we define a user's social influence on a given event as the proportion of the user's friends who are influenced by him/her to attend the event. To solve this problem, we present a hybrid collaborative filtering model, namely, Matrix Factorization with Event-User Neighborhood (MF-EUN) model, by incorporating both event-based and user-based neighborhood methods into matrix factorization. Due to the fact that the constructed social influence matrix is very sparse and the overlap values in the matrix are few, it is challenging to find reliable similar neighbors using the widely adopted similarity measures (e.g., Pearson correlation and Cosine similarity). To address this challenge, we propose an additional information based neighborhood discovery (AID) method by considering both event-specific and user-specific features in EBSNs. The parameters of our MF-EUN model are determined by minimizing the associated regularized squared error function through stochastic gradient descent. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation on real-world datasets collected from DoubanEvent. Experimental results show that our proposed hybrid collaborative filtering model is superior than several alternatives, which provides excellent performance with RMSE and MAE reaching 0.248 and 0.1266 respectively in the 90% training data of 10 000 users dataset.\"], 'C1': ['[Li, Xiao; Cheng, Xiang; Su, Sen; Li, Shuchen; Yang, Jianyu] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.'], 'RP': ['Su, S (reprint author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.'], 'EM': ['lixiao@bupt.edu.cn; susen@bupt.edu.cn'], 'FU': ['National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science', 'Foundation of China [61502047]'], 'FX': ['The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of', 'China under grant 61502047, the Co-construction Program with the Beijing', 'Municipal Commission of Education.'], 'CR': [{'ref': \"Zhang W, 2015, KDD'15: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 21ST ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, P1455\", 'DOI': '10.1145/2783258.2783336'}], 'NR': ['39'], 'TC': ['13'], 'Z9': ['14'], 'U1': ['2'], 'U2': ['37'], 'PU': ['ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV'], 'PI': ['AMSTERDAM'], 'PA': ['PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS'], 'SN': ['0925-2312'], 'EI': ['1872-8286'], 'J9': ['NEUROCOMPUTING'], 'JI': ['Neurocomputing'], 'PD': ['MAR 22'], 'PY': ['2017'], 'VL': ['230'], 'BP': ['197'], 'EP': ['209'], 'DI': ['10.1016/j.neucom.2016.12.024'], 'PG': ['13'], 'WC': ['Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence'], 'SC': ['Computer Science'], 'GA': ['EK6UR'], 'UT': ['WOS:000394061800018'], 'DA': ['2019-11-15']}\n",

However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts. To populate the graphs, knowledge graph embedding models have been developed. Knowledge graph embedding models map entities and relations in a knowledge graph to a vector space and predict unknown triples by scoring candidate triples. TransE is the first translation-based method and it is well known because of its simplicity and efficiency for knowledge graph completion. It employs the principle that the differences between entity embeddings represent their relations. The principle seems very simple, but it can effectively capture the rules of a knowledge graph. However, TransE has a problem with its regularization. TransE forces entity embeddings to be on a sphere in the embedding vector space. This regularization warps the embeddings and makes it difficult for them to fulfill the abovementioned principle. The regularization also affects adversely the accuracies of the link predictions. On the other hand, regularization is important because entity embeddings diverge by negative sampling without it. This paper proposes a novel embedding model, TorusE, to solve the regularization problem. The principle of TransE can be defined on any Lie group. A torus, which is one of the compact Lie groups, can be chosen for the embedding space to avoid regularization. To the best of our knowledge, TorusE is the first model that embeds objects on other than a real or complex vector space, and this paper is the first to formally discuss the problem of regularization of TransE. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as TransE, DistMult and ComplEx on a standard link prediction task.

We address that the information diffusion process across networks naturally reflects rich proximity relationships between users. Meanwhile, social networks contain multiple communities regularizing communication pathways for information propagation. Based on the above observations, we propose a probabilistic generative model, called COSINE, to learn community-preserving social network embeddings from the recurrent and time-stamped social contagion logs, namely information diffusion cascades.

One interesting and important problem in the social networking services is to rank users based on their vitality in a timely fashion. An accurate ranking list of user vitality could benefit many parties in social network services such as the ads providers and site operators. Although it is very promising to obtain a vitality-based ranking list of users, there are many technical challenges due to the large scale and dynamics of social networking data. In this paper, we propose a unique perspective to achieve this goal, which is quantifying user vitality by analyzing the dynamic interactions among users on social networks. Examples of social network include but are not limited to social networks in microblog sites and academical collaboration networks. Intuitively, if a user has many interactions with his friends within a time period and most of his friends do not have many interactions with their friends simultaneously, it is very likely that this user has high vitality. Based on this idea, we develop quantitative measurements for user vitality and propose our first algorithm for ranking users based vitality. Also, we further consider the mutual influence between users while computing the vitality measurements and propose the second ranking algorithm, which computes user vitality in an iterative way. Other than user vitality ranking, we also introduce a vitality prediction problem, which is also of great importance for many applications in social networking services. Along this line, we develop a customized prediction model to solve the vitality prediction problem. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we collect two dynamic social network data sets.

To this end, the social-spatial influence and social-temporal influence are analyzed synthetically in this paper based on the related information exposed in LBSNs. The check-in movement behaviors of users are found to be affected by their social friendships both from spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, a probabilistic model of user mobile behavior is proposed, incorporating the comprehensive social influence model with extent personal preference model.

On the other hand, we employ our benchmark to evaluate and compare the performance of several state-of-theart metric learning based kinship verification methods.

However, most existing embedding methods focus on the static network while neglecting the evolving characteristic of real-world networks. Meanwhile, most of previous methods cannot well preserve the high-order proximity, which is a critical structural property of networks. These problems motivate us to seek an effective and efficient way to preserve the high-order proximity in embedding vectors when the networks evolve over time. In this paper, we propose a novel method of Dynamic High-order Proximity preserved Embedding (DHPE). Specifically, we adopt the generalized SVD (GSVD) to preserve the high-order proximity. Then, by transforming the GSVD problem to a generalized eigenvalue problem, we propose a generalized eigen perturbation to incrementally update the results of GSVD to incorporate the changes of dynamic networks. Further, we propose an accelerated solution to the DHPE model so that it achieves a linear time complexity with respect to the number of nodes and number of changed edges in the network.

Especially, the widespread of video in social media and intelligent surveillance gives us a new chance to discover the social relations among people. Previous researches mostly focus on the recognition of social relations from texts, blogs, or images. However, these methods are only concentrated on limited social relations and incapable of dealing with video data. In this paper, we address the challenges of social relation recognition by employing a multi-stream model to exploit the abundant multimodal information in videos. First of all, we build a video dataset with 16 categories of social relations annotation according to psychology and sociology studies, named Social Relation In Videos (SRIV), which comprises of 3,124 videos. According to our knowledge, it is the first video dataset for the social relation recognition. Secondly, we propose a multi-stream deep learning model as a benchmark for recognizing social relations, which learns high level semantic information of spatial, temporal, and audio of people's social interactions in videos. Finally, we fuse them with logical regression to achieve accurate recognition. Experimental results show that the multi-stream deep model is effective for social relation recognition on the proposed dataset.\"], 'C1': ['[Lv, Jinna; Liu, Wu; Zhou, Lili; Wu, Bin; Ma, Huadong] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing Key Lab Intelligent Telecommun Software &, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.'], 'RP': ['Wu, B (reprint author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing Key Lab Intelligent Telecommun Software &, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.'], 'EM': ['lvjinna@bupt.edu.cn; liuwu@bupt.edu.cn; xuanyuanjian@bupt.edu.cn;', 'wubin@bupt.edu.cn; mhd@bupt.edu.cn'], 'FU': ['National High-tech RD Program [2015AA050204]; Special Found for Beijing', 'Common Construction Project; National Natural Science Foundation of', 'ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [61602049];', 'Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental', 'Research Funds for the Central Universities [2016RCGD32]'], 'FX': ['This research is supported in part by the National High-tech R&D Program', '(No. 2015AA050204), the Special Found for Beijing Common Construction', 'Project, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.', '61602049), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central', 'Universities (No. 2016RCGD32).'], 'CR': [{'ref': 'Zhang ZP, 2015, IEEE I CONF COMP VIS, P3631', 'DOI': '10.1109/ICCV.2015.414'}], 'NR': ['19'], 'TC': ['0'], 'Z9': ['0'], 'U1': ['0'], 'U2': ['0'], 'PU': ['SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG'], 'PI': ['CHAM'], 'PA': ['GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND'], 'SN': ['0302-9743'], 'EI': ['1611-3349'], 'BN': ['978-3-319-73603-7; 978-3-319-73602-0'], 'J9': ['LECT NOTES COMPUT SC'], 'PY': ['2018'], 'VL': ['10704'], 'BP': ['355'], 'EP': ['368'], 'DI': ['10.1007/978-3-319-73603-7_29'], 'PN': ['I'], 'PG': ['14'], 'WC': ['Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory &', 'Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic'], 'SC': ['Computer Science; Engineering'], 'GA': ['BL9IG'], 'UT': ['WOS:000457466000029'], 'DA': ['2019-11-15']}\n",

We propose a highly efficient node embedding method, DNPS, that is faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art methods and that can further boost the training progress, especially under dynamic conditions. In this paper, we attempt to model the hierarchical and dynamic features of social networks by designing a damping-based sampling algorithm corresponding to a local search-based incremental learning algorithm, which can easily be extended to large-scale scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world social networks with three challenging tasks, including missing link prediction, dynamic link prediction, and multi-label classification.
