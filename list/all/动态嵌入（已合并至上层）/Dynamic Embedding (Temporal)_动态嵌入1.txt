Using NMF in semi-supervised classification problems, its factors are the label matrix and the membership values of data points. In this paper, a dynamic weakly supervised factorization is proposed to learn a classifier using NMF framework and partially supervised data. Also, a label propagation mechanism is used to initialize the label matrix factor of NMF. Besides a graph based method is used to dynamically update the partially labeled data in each iteration. This mechanism leads to enriching the supervised information in each iteration and consequently improves the classification performance. Several experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and the results show its superiority compared to a state-of-the-art method.", "keywords": ["Semi-supervised learning", "Semi nonnegative matrix factorization", "Graph Regularization Label propagation"], "reference_count": 25, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] O.

The learned embeddings could advance various learning tasks such as node classification, network clustering, and link prediction. Most, if not all, of the existing works, are overwhelmingly performed in the context of plain and static networks. Nonetheless, in reality, network structure often evolves over time with addition/deletion of links and nodes. Also, a vast majority of real-world networks are associated with a rich set of node attributes, and their attribute values are also naturally changing, with the emerging of new content patterns and the fading of old content patterns. These changing characteristics motivate us to seek an effective embedding representation to capture network and attribute evolving patterns, which is of fundamental importance for learning in a dynamic environment. To our best knowledge, we are the first to tackle this problem with the following two challenges: (1) the inherently correlated network and node attributes could be noisy and incomplete, it necessitates a robust consensus representation to capture their individual properties and correlations; (2) the embedding learning needs to be performed in an online fashion to adapt to the changes accordingly. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a novel dynamic attributed network embedding framework - DANE. In particular, DANE first provides an offline method for a consensus embedding and then leverages matrix perturbation theory to maintain the freshness of the end embedding results in an online manner. We perform extensive experiments on both synthetic and real attributed networks to corroborate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.", "keywords": ["Dynamic Networks", "A\u008attributed Networks", "Network Embedding"], "reference_count": 56, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Lada A Adamic and Bernardo A Huberman. 2000.

One basic requirement of network embedding is to preserve the structure and inherent properties of the networks. While previous network embedding methods primarily preserve the microscopic structure, such as the first- and second-order proximities of nodes, the mesoscopic community structure, which is one of the most prominent feature of networks, is largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel Modularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (M-NMF) model to incorporate the community structure into network embedding. We exploit the consensus relationship between the representations of nodes and community structure, and then jointly optimize NMF based representation learning model and modularity based community detection model in a unified framework, which enables the learned representations of nodes to preserve both of the microscopic and community structures. We also provide efficient updating rules to infer the parameters of our model, together with the correctness and convergence guarantees.

Examples include epidemic threshold, graph robustness, etc. It is often of key importance to accurately monitor these parameters. For example, knowing that Ebola virus has already been brought to the US continent, to avoid the virus from spreading away, it is important to know which emerging connections among related people would cause great reduction on the epidemic threshold of the network. However, most, if not all, of the existing algorithms computing these measures assume that the input graph is static, despite the fact that almost all real graphs are evolving over time. In this paper, we propose two online algorithms to track the eigen-functions of a dynamic graph with linear complexity wrt the number of nodes and number of changed edges in the graph. The key idea is to leverage matrix perturbation theory to efficiently update the top eigen-pairs of the underlying graph without recomputing them from scratch at each time stamp.

However, most existing embedding methods focus on the static network while neglecting the evolving characteristic of real-world networks. Meanwhile, most of previous methods cannot well preserve the high-order proximity, which is a critical structural property of networks. These problems motivate us to seek an effective and efficient way to preserve the high-order proximity in embedding vectors when the networks evolve over time. In this paper, we propose a novel method of Dynamic High-order Proximity preserved Embedding (DHPE). Specifically, we adopt the generalized SVD (GSVD) to preserve the high-order proximity. Then, by transforming the GSVD problem to a generalized eigenvalue problem, we propose a generalized eigen perturbation to incrementally update the results of GSVD to incorporate the changes of dynamic networks. Further, we propose an accelerated solution to the DHPE model so that it achieves a linear time complexity with respect to the number of nodes and number of changed edges in the network.

However, the cold-start issue and the special properties of social networks, such as rich temporal dynamics, heterogeneous and complex structures with millions of nodes, render the most commonly used recommendation approaches (e.g. Collaborative Filtering) inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-granularity dynamic network embedding (m-DNE) model for the social recommendation which is capable of recommending relevant users and interested items. In order to support online recommendation, we construct a heterogeneous user-item (HUI) network and incrementally maintain it as the social network evolves. m-DNE jointly captures the temporal semantic effects, social relationships and user behavior sequential patterns in a unified way by embedding the HUI network into a shared low dimensional space. Meanwhile, multi-granularity proximities which include the second-order proximity and the community-aware high-order proximity of nodes, are introduced to learn more informative and robust network representations. Then, with an efficient search method, we use the encoded representation of temporal contexts to generate recommendations. Experimental results on several real large-scale datasets show its advantages over other state-of-the-art methods.", "keywords": ["Social recommendation", "Heterogeneous social network", "Network embedding", "Temporal context", "Community detection"], "reference_count": 26, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1]Sedhain, S., Sanner, S., Braziunas, D., Xie, L., Christensen, J.: Social collaborative filtering for cold-start recommendations.

The current related work on node embedding exploits only a portion of existing networks, e.g., static networks. However, social networks are inherently hierarchical and dynamic systems in which the topology changes constantly and the strength of influence of information among neighbors varies with different numbers of hops. We propose a highly efficient node embedding method, DNPS, that is faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art methods and that can further boost the training progress, especially under dynamic conditions. In this paper, we attempt to model the hierarchical and dynamic features of social networks by designing a damping-based sampling algorithm corresponding to a local search-based incremental learning algorithm, which can easily be extended to large-scale scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world social networks with three challenging tasks, including missing link prediction, dynamic link prediction, and multi-label classification. The results of the experiments on these tasks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods with different settings.", "keywords": ["Node embeddings", "distributed representation", "dynamic social networks", "link analysis"], "reference_count": 49, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] M.

The model assumes that each user lies in an unobserved latent space, and interactions are more likely to occur between similar users in the latent space representation. In addition, the model allows each user to gradually move its position in the latent space as the network structure evolves over time. We present a global optimization algorithm to effectively infer the temporal latent space. Two alternative optimization algorithms with local and incremental updates are also proposed, allowing the model to scale to larger networks without compromising prediction accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model, when evaluated on a number of real-world dynamic networks, significantly outperforms existing approaches for temporal link prediction in terms of both scalability and predictive power.", "keywords": ["Latent space model", "link prediction", "non-negative matrix factorization", "social network analysis"], "reference_count": 49, "ccfClass": "A", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] M.

Incremental SVD approaches are proposed to process newly changed nodes and edges in dynamic networks. However, incremental SVD approaches suffer from serious error accumulation inevitably due to approximation on incremental updates. SVD restart is an effective approach to reset the aggregated error, but when to restart SVD for dynamic networks is not addressed in literature. In this paper, we propose TIMERS, Theoretically Instructed Maximum-Error-bounded Restart of SVD, a novel approach which optimally sets the restart time in order to reduce error accumulation in time. Specifically, we monitor the margin between reconstruction loss of incremental updates and the minimum loss in SVD model. To reduce the complexity of monitoring, we theoretically develop a lower bound of SVD minimum loss for dynamic networks and use the bound to replace the minimum loss in monitoring. By setting a maximum tolerated error as a threshold, we can trigger SVD restart automatically when the margin exceeds this threshold. We prove that the time complexity of our method is linear with respect to the number of local dynamic changes, and our method is general across different types of dynamic networks. We conduct extensive experiments on several synthetic and real dynamic networks. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods by reducing 27% to 42% in terms of the maximum error for dynamic network reconstruction when fixing the number of restarts. Our method reduces the number of restarts by 25% to 50% when fixing the maximum error tolerated.", "keywords": ["0"], "reference_count": 20, "ccfClass": "B", "important": true, "references": [{"ref": "[1] Barab \u00b4 asi, A.-L., and Albert, R. \u00b4 1999.
